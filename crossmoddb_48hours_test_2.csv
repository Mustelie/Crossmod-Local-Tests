There's a real justification for it: all wealth produced within a society is only possible because of the structures and mechanism provided by that society. Capitalism, and the capitalists who run it, eagerly want you to believe that they just produce wealth out of thin air by sheer hard work and ingenuity. In actuality, the basic premise of all value is labor, and those with large estates are overwhelmingly likely to have concentrated that wealth through the exploitation of labor and the deployment of a favorable economy that incentivizes such behavior; taxing that massive estate is a way to return a share of that wealth back into the society that produced it (instead of simply going to someone who did even less to earn it than its ""creator). Even if you do somehow believe the bootstrap myth, an estate tax is a mechanism that strengthens meritocracy (and thus, under liberal thought, innovation and efficiency) by funding services and systems that allow future people to similarly build wealth to themselves.  


Of course, like with all revenue, the US does a pretty horrible job of actually allocating resources where they're needed, but that's a different discussion than whether a valid justification exists in the first place.",0.14560585,EMPTY,Aethelric,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

>Not to mention that many stressed people spend all of their time working, again, without resorting to vice. Nor to mention that low IQ is caused by environmental factors, not stress.

Judging by your response here, I have to assume you haven't actually been [exposed to any of the research surrounding this.](https://www.pbs.org/newshour/economy/making-sense/analysis-how-poverty-can-drive-down-intelligence)

I'll copy the first sentence here because it dispels the class shaming fallacy of ""being poor is a lack of character"" in full force. I encourage you to read it as it might add perspective.

>If you think you know the cost of being poor, unless you have actually been poor, you’re probably wrong. 

The rest of your comment also seems to disregard what the poor actually go through so I encourage you to read the article. Classicism is just a prevalent as racism and the two are nigh intertwined.

Billionaires do not pay less taxes than normal Americans. You're, perhaps, thinking of Warren Buffett paying a lower marginal tax RATE than his secretary. Income tax and capital gains taxes aside, billionaires pay a hell of a lot of the total tax revenue in the US. 

The government doesn't generate tax dollars from billionaires through wages.   Most of the tax revenue generated is through capital gains and dividends and it happens at a lower percentage than the average American is taxed on income.  

Just take a look at this Forbes article.

This is false unless you extract the situation into very abstract terms, in which case it has no meaning anymore.

>Capitalism, and the capitalists who run it, eagerly want you to believe that they just produce wealth out of thin air by sheer hard work and ingenuity.

No they don't, they want you to believe that wealth is produced through voluntary transactions, which it is. 

>In actuality, the basic premise of all value is labor, and those with large estates are overwhelmingly likely to have concentrated that wealth through the exploitation of labor

This is false. This is very extremely false. Labor does NOT create value. Value is largely independent of labor. Value exists through voluntary transactions. Nothing has inherent value. Labor has value through the market, the market (which is shaped by voluntary transactions) decides wages and salaries. And the market decides the value of goods and services. If the value is estimated too high, or too low, it will eventually be corrected. More or less labor does not make something more or less valuable. Furthermore, labor is not exploited, because it was offered voluntarily and the value agreed upon by both parties. The idea that wealth is created by an exploitation of labor is only found when misunderstanding what creates value. The reality is that those with large estates are just more successful, and it happens, and some people don't like that.

>deployment of a favorable economy that incentivizes such behavior;

Yes, the economy incentivizes success and hard work. Not everyone is successful. That's not a failure of the economic system. Nor does that fact entitle people to someone else's success.

>taxing that massive estate is a way to return a share of that wealth back into the society that produced it (instead of simply going to someone who did even less to earn it than its ""creator).

Society didn't create that wealth. If it did, why do only some people have that wealth? We're all members of society. Maybe those people did something different? And you don't know what the recipient of an estate did or didn't do to contribute. Nor does it matter, because society didn't generate that wealth, its owner did, and its owner is the one who should decide who is our isn't a worthy recipient of their own wealth. 

>Even if you do somehow believe the bootstrap myth, an estate tax is a mechanism that strengthens meritocracy (and thus, under liberal thought, innovation and efficiency) by funding services and systems that allow future people to similarly build wealth to themselves. 

It weakens meritocracy because it implies you don't actually own what you earn, and that you don't need to earn what you own. Meritocracy rewards you when you earn it. What you're arguing is that society shouldn't be a meritocracy because what you earn will be taken from you and what you don't earn will be given to you. That's the exact opposite. 

The voluntary transfer of wealth after death is your right as a human being. Respecting your decision to do with your property as you decide is humane and good. Sneaking in right after you die to take what is yours and rightfully your chosen recipient's is ethically wrong. It's graverobbing, plain and simple. You decide who earns your wealth, not anyone else. You pay your dues to society throughout your entire life. It's not like there aren't taxes already to pay for whatever society does for you. To argue that in death even more taxes are necessary is simply laughable. It's ridiculous. Why don't you take what you're taking while they're still alive? Why wait until they're dead and can't protest? It's slimy bureaucratic bullshit. 

And if you want to argue about exploitation of labor, taxes come from literally stealing what people earn through their own labor. People aren't slaves. They work voluntarily. They choose to provide their labor in exchange for a wage. Then the government comes in and just takes a part of that wage for nothing. There are government services, sure, but that was your labor that you chose to exchange for money. You can choose to work for your employer, you can't choose to work for the government. I'm not gonna say we should get rid of all taxes or anything, but at least you can half justify those.

Even the ""study"" from the ""progressive"" doesn't say what you think it says. 

> the nation’s richest taxpayers are paying a share of overall taxes that slightly exceeds their share of income. 

....

> Meanwhile, the poorest fifth of Americans will receive only a small fraction of the nation’s income (2.8 percent) and, as a result, will pay a small fraction of the total federal, state and local taxes (2 percent). 

So even when we look at ridiculous things like sales tax, the rich are STILL paying a larger percentage of the taxes then the income they earn and the bottom are STILL paying a SMALLER percentage of the taxes than the income they earn. Of course they never bother to mention the bottom 47% pay ZERO DOLLARS in federal income tax while the top twenty percent pay 87%. 

Slightly EXCEEDS their share of income. EXCEEDS. No do the bottom fifty percent! 

Oddly, this ""study"" only looks at the top once percent and the bottom fifth. No mention of the top twenty percent. Huh 

> It is true that some of our revenue sources are quite progressive, including the federal personal income tax, corporate income tax and estate tax.[\[1\]](https://itep.org/who-pays-taxes-in-america-in-2019/#_edn1) 

Ahahahahah ""quite progressive"". Wait, I thought the rich weren't paying their ""fair share'? 

> For example, everyone who works pays the Social Security payroll tax. This tax does not apply to the investment income that most very wealthy families have, and it only applies to the first $132,900 of earnings a worker receives in 2019. 

LOL so ALL EARNERS pay social security taxes, but since it doesn't apply to investment income...? Tell me, if you don't PAY INTO social security do you get to collect social security? Now tell me what would happen to your social security ""income"" if you invested it in the DOW or a decent index fund? It's also amusing that you seem to think you're paying for anyone else's social security but your own. 

> Americans also pay state and local taxes that are particularly regressive, meaning they capture a larger share of income from low- or middle-income families than from wealthy families. State and local income taxes are much less progressive than the federal income tax, and some states have no income tax at all. 

Ahahahahahaaa!!!! ""some states have no income tax at all"". Sacre blue! They should be taking more money from people!!!

> State and local sales taxes are paid by virtually everyone. These are particularly regressive because poor families have little choice but to spend all their income buying necessities while wealthy families can save most of their income, shielding it from sales taxes. 

This is straight up lying. The rich pay MUCH MUCH MUCH more than the poor in sales taxes as a percentage of income and an overall percentage. I mean how much tax do you think someone pays on a $40 million yacht? 

> The figures in this report **estimate** combined federal, state and local taxes paid in the United States in 2019. They show that overall, our tax system is moderately progressive and people at every income level are paying taxes in the aggregate.

It literally one aspect of investment that everyone around you is doing that you are obviously too stupid to be doing. And you pay SALES tax on food. You pay PROPERTY  tax on a home. These are completely disparate mechanisms that have nothing to do with income. A home is an appreciating asset, which you can use similar to a stock... flipping houses can yield short term capital gains or you can rent homes and create passive income.  But that is still earned income subject to income tax. 

Investing in the stock market for long term savings, to stay ahead of inflation so that you don't lose purchasing power over time... that is not something that you want explosively taxed as a normal person. It's the same vehicle that wealthy people use, in addition to dividends as a means to make their ""passive"" income. Driving the capital gains tax up only hurts the economy.

1571110176.0,1571110185.0986264,f3svdgb,"It seems to stem from an idea that because we exist, we are entitled to certain things. I had an argument not long ago for example about if having Internet in your own home was a right or not. What do you mean when you even say such a thing? You're not even entitled to food just because you're alive.

Imagine for a moment that there's one human being in all the world...you. If you choose to do nothing besides sit there, you will die. The default state won't be happiness. It won't be pleasure. It won't be life. You'll feel the full brunt of the weather. You'll blister in the burning sun or freeze in the chilling cold. You'll become dehydrated and hungry. Chances aren't bad that an animal will attack, or even kill you--or worst yet, it'll just maim you, causing even additional suffrage until you finally do die. The world doesn't give you anything for being alive. Have you ever watched a nature documentary? Ever seen animals brutally kill one another? Rip one another limb to limb? Baby animals, just born, eaten moments after birth? What about creatures that eat, or just violently kill their own offspring? Do these creatures come with such entitlements? No. Millions of animals die from starvation, disease, violence, and more, and humans are still animals, much as we want to believe otherwise sometimes.

So you're the only person in the world and you have to toil and suffer in order to even stave off SOME of the suffrage that's thrust upon you. With more humans, you might work together (or attack one another) in order to hope to alleviate more suffrage, but nothing you will ever do will guarantee its stave completely.

We in the west live in a veritable Eden. We know no starvation and almost no one knows of hunger beyond the occasional skipped meal or diet due to being constantly surrounded by a potential feast the likes of which none in our ancestry could even concoct had we dreamed for 10,000 years. Every way we turn are options to eat virtually anything you can imagine. Foods that are transported thousands of miles. Foods imported from islands, or nations across the oceans. Foods prepared by chefs and served to you by others by your beck and call, and all while sitting in the comforts of a nice chair, heat or air conditioning, no concern for the weather, and no fear of predator or prospective human assailant come to take your food from you by force, just to feed a starving family.

Never in the existing of humanity have we known so many pleasures and so few woes, yet even still do the monsters of anxiety and suffrage follow. So now, unknown of hunger, disease, or fear of nature's teeth do we covet what we see others have. I drive a new SUV. I'm sitting in a $400 computer chair right now. I make a comfortable salary. There are those in my life who covet these things. They want what I have, and I've heard my share of excuses as to why I didn't earn any of it, and why they should have it too.

But none of that are ""rights"". These are wants. Whims. Desires for what your neighbor has. And the deadliest snake of all in such light is the one that enraptures others and uses force to obtain what they don't have. It's a road to hell, paved with proverbially good intentions, but the road is to fire and brimstone none the less.

So do you deserve a big screen TV? A new car? Internet in your home? On what device? A cell phone? Is food to be given to you on your demand? What kinds of food? Should it be cakes and candies, fizzy drinks and steaks? Fast food? Or just enough to stay healthy? Foods rich in nutrients that may not be as warm and inviting as is the chocolate fondue?

It's entitlement, plain and simple. It's a brainwashing, or an ignorance. It's never considering the ramifications of what your choices make of you, and the impact that those choices have on everyone else. We have people complaining about student loans, claiming to barely get by--the same people who leave their home a mess, their health a wreck, and who had unprotected sex with the wrong person. I've finished two degrees. I'm down to $9,000 in student loans and I just finished my second degree in 2016. No family nor friend gave me a dime of assistance there. I paid every cent myself. I doubled my salary in 3 years. I'm not saying I'm perfection--far, oh so far from it--I am saying that if one man can do it, any man thus has the potential. If not, then I am beyond the rest, and do any of you really believe that? No? Then everyone is as like me, an equal, capable of making their own success and granting themselves their own financial freedom and security.

Life is fucking hard. Sometimes it's almost too hard to handle, but it's a hell of a lot more secure, safe, and free than it has been for 99.9% of our ancestors, who lived in constant fear of nature's whim, unknown if they would eat on any given day. Unsure why their mouth was filled with rot as teeth fell out bloodily, and crying in agony to questionable gods the sheer denial of why their small child just passed away in their arms.

That's just flat out incorrect. Try this saying. As the rich get richer, so do the poor. Nothing new is avaliable to everyone everywhere, right away. But as the rich invest in luxuries, their price tends to drop and avaliability goes up. For example: Only the very wealthy could even afford a computer. and now almost everyone, even in developing nations, have access to tiny, powerful pocket communitations devices. All because of capitalism.  


The next stipulation, is that we need, free market capitalim, where every man is able to follow what ever dream they have, without being buttfucked into submission by government regulations created by regulatory capture.  


Crony capitalism is what has created many of the bad outcome in todays capitalist world, but even then, crony capitalism has proven to be the far superior system, to anything else tried. What would be even better would be a truely free form of capitalism.

In a sense, you're right. Everyone here is presupposing that you believe taxation should be equitable, fair, and minimally intrusive while maximizing revenue. If you don't want these things then that's a different thing. There's debate of course about what the ideal distribution should be, but not that there should be a distribution. 

No honest economist will claim a flat tax accomplishes these things. It is  demonstrably, historically, and logically true.

There's no ""hybrid"" position between killing all the jews and not, the same way there's no hybrid between taxing everyone the same and not. They are by definition mutually exclusive. You're arguing that we explore an option that literally doesn't exist. 

Though to be perfectly honest, we sort of have a hybrid in the US now in that sales tax is a flat tax and income is bracketed, but again if your goal is to find the most fair and least burdensome distribution a flat tax isn't the answer. This is why there isn't sales tax in most European countries.",0.22219382,EMPTY,avacado_of_the_devil,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Because Wages don't represent wealth. I assume that you never lived in the 70's, but have you not seen the sheer amount of technological innovation and wealth creation that has happenend in this time? China has completeley developed as a nation in this time, since they moved to a psuedo-capitalist model, instead of full moaist.   


> Wealth disparity is only growing larger over time, reaching near Gilded Age levels. 

Mostly thanks to government intevention, and crony capitalism. However, your missing the part where in the last 50 years, billions of people have been brought out of poverty.  


> While the poor may be richer than they were a century ago, it only got  to this point due to unions fighting for things taken for granted like  the 8 hour workday, 5 day week, minimum wage, the abolition of child  labor, etc as well as through government intervention. 

What the fuck? Your argument isn't even an argument. Unions have every right to exist in a free market, and should be applauded. Government intervention generally creates more issues than it fixes. And government intervention is most certainly not what created the massive amounts of wealth that exist in todays society, which most people have.  


> The consumerization of computers was only possible due to large  government subsidies and investment. The internet as we know it today  was made possible due to the efforts of CERN, funded by numerous  European nations. 

And all of these things could fucking exist without all of that forced funding, and research.   
Fucking Microsoft, apple, samsung, FB, google, are the people innovating and making machines and technology, not the government.

&#x200B;

> A lack of regulation is what lead us to monopolies being able to outcompete anyone who tried to compete 

No it fuckign isn't. Learn about regulatory capture. Regulations are literally obsticles for new businesses to navigate, and if they are too big, confusing, and restrictive (like they currently are) then it actively hinders new competition from entering the market. Often the big businesses lobby governments for regulations which they are able to comply with, but no other company smaller then a few million are even able meet those new regulations. It's government and big business that fucks up capitalism to create our current issues. not freedom to start any business you want.  


> It would seem like these monopolies would be even more prevalent due to a  lack of antitrust legislation. An monopoly could simply outcompete any  form of competition that sprang up through anticompetitive practices. A  lack of regulation and oversight would only serve to amplify this.

* Delivering value to our customers. We will further the tradition of American companies leading the way in meeting or exceeding customer expectations.
* Investing in our employees. This starts with compensating them fairly and providing important benefits. It also includes supporting them through training and education that help develop new skills for a rapidly changing world. We foster diversity and inclusion, dignity and respect.
* Dealing fairly and ethically with our suppliers. We are dedicated to serving as good partners to the other companies, large and small, that help us meet our missions.
* Supporting the communities in which we work. We respect the people in our communities and protect the environment by embracing sustainable practices across our businesses.
* Generating long-term value for shareholders, who provide the capital that allows companies to invest, grow and innovate. We are committed to transparency and effective engagement with shareholders.

Renewables are expanding anyway largely because state Renewable Portfolio Standards mandate that a certain percentage of power *must* come from renewables *no matter how much they cost*. But more and more people are recognizing that it is cheaper to operate an existing nuclear plant than to build new wind and solar capacity which seldom deliver on the promise of being ""cheap"" (just ask Germany), and that it is an outright racket to protect *some* clean energy sources but not others. So many states are replacing their obsolete RPS programs with Clean Energy Standards that include nuclear power, *even California*.

It's a bit more than that, but it is essentailly that. You could be more clear and say, capitalism is a system in which individuals partake in the voluntary exchange of goods and sevices they own, without external coercion.

The consumer IS THE FUCKING MONEY SUPPLY. Jesus chist. Businesses don't convince the government to make you buy from them. Businesses convince you to buy from them. Hence why millions of businesses are tryign to go carbon nuteral, and support things like LGBT pride.

> It would be a huge waste to try and build new infrastructure out of  nothing while actively being prevented from doing so by the whole  system. Much simpler to just take what is already there. 

ok. Nothing in free market capitalism theoretically stops that from happening. If people actually want change. They can bring it. Companies are made up of workers. Companies only make money from consumers (when the government isn't invovled and giving free money). Workers and consumers are the same people. They are all people who can make these decisions. Democracy is jsut the peoples will. So instead of crying that governmetns need to create change. Why don't the fuckign people just create change. People are the ones in charge of everything.

&#x200B;

> Nice, straight up admitting that corporations only do what is most profitable. 

Yes, profit is a motivator in capitalism. And if you refuse to give money to businesses that don't follow your values, then you force them to find other ways to get that revenue. Do you think that people go to work, because they are nice and want to help society? No the only fuckign reason anyone gets a job, is so that they can make profit. and buy shit with their money.

Firstly three trickle up joke was a reference to the decided trickle down theory: https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Trickle-down_economics

Secondly investments or interest in more general creates debt. £1000 invested returns £1100, but that additional £100 was not in the system to begin with, it exists as debt. There is presently more debt than money in world due to this effect. When Banks create money for mortgages and the like, they also create debt in the form of interest payments, and people have to pay those payments by removing money from other systems.

Finally the effects of giving more money to the rich negligible in terms of benefits to the economy. While looking for a source on the net impacts of interest on the rich and poor I found a guardian article that explains things more clearly than I could:

Remind me who the people were who kept saying, and still do, that humanity couldn't possibly influence the climate, no sirree. Only God could possibly do that. 

>The first half of this century has apparently been the warmest period since the “hot spell” between 5,000 and 7,000 years ago immediately following the last ice age. That the climate, at least in the Northern Hemisphere, has been getting cooler since about 1950, is well estabt lished—if one ignores the last two winters.

>It had been forecast by some specialists that last winter would be exceptionally cold, but as all ice skaters know, it was unusually mild in the New York area. In Boston it was the warmest in 22 years and in Moscow it was the second warmest in 230 years.

>**A major problem in seeking to assess the trend is to distinguish year‐to‐year fluctuations from those spread over decades, centuries and thousands of years.**

Besides, aot of these articles are throughout the 70s. [You know, the time](https://wbkr.com/who-remembers-massive-snow-storms-in-consecutive-winters-in-the-late-70s/) there were massive blizzards and insane snowstorms and severe cold.

Did you forget the arctic vortex from last year? Does that mean jack shit? [You realise how it could be caused?](https://theconversation.com/how-frigid-polar-vortex-blasts-are-connected-to-global-warming-110653)

And what about the extreme heat everywhere else? The consistenly high record breaking temperatures year after year after year. You realise, I hope that climate change doesn't mean you either get an ice age or a burning planet, it differs. Extreme weather gets more extreme, no matter if it's cold or warm.

The foreign elites who come here are just as likely as the ones here already to refrain from having children. It's happening in every wealthy nation in the world, even worse in Asia than the US. Japan is in a demographic death-spiral, so is Korea, so is Taiwan, and soon so will be China.

Secondly, most of USA including the ""white"" population, are also the descendants of highly motivated immigrants, so again, by your logic, you should not attribute the privileged position of the USA to race.

Thirdly, latino refugees are more motivated than the resident population in USA, and perform better economically, so again one should not attribute to race what is simply circumstances. USA had many waves of ""white"" immigrants from England and Poland and Ireland and Italy, which makes the migrant effect less clear, but in general, after a few generations performance returns to the mean for the native population.

Lastly, race is largely a construct of those who want to put people in neat little categories. Genes travel far and wide, as do people, and it is mainly due to the founder effect of migrant groups that you have groups of relatively homogenous people. 

To conclude, and referencing back to the original topic, people opting not to have children is a largely education and cultural issue, and as long as the same education and culture persist it will not die with the people who did not have children. Japan has been having demographic issues for nearly 3 generations now, and the birth rate is just getting worse. South Korea has a birth rate of less than 1 per woman, and the population is expected to start shrinking next year. Massive China with more than 1 billion people are also well below replacement. 

In short,** its education, not intelligence,** which is the issue. If you educate the native population (especially women) in Nigeria or Afganistan, you see the same effect.  Educated people realize life is about more than having children, and that they have options to do other things with their lives.

So if you are genuinely worried about overpopulation and an environmental crisis support foreign aid, in particular, educational aid, and oppose those measures that prevent birth control from being offered by aid organizations, the most bizarre platform from republicans ever. Help women take control of their fertility in their native lands and you will see birth rates plummet further. **It's really that simple and very pragmatic.**",0.2479381,EMPTY,Surur,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

The people who conducted the study found that poverty in itself does not 'reduce IQ', but rather 'suppresses it', i.e. that it uses cognitive capacity. They suggest that the poor use this capacity on money-related worries. As such, the poor should be *better* able to save money, not less, than people who are more well off.

> Some people change the world so why don't you?  

I do. Why else do you think I'd care what other people do? It's because there's nothing more annoying than seeing people live the wrong way when it's so obvious that they could do better.

I lived in poverty before. I had around 4 USD to spend each day on food—in my city, just enough for three meals of 'bulk-buy' rice + multivitamin, mineral and omega-3/6 supplements, since I couldn't afford a varied diet—and I had trouble securing a safe place to sleep, since I couldn't afford the rent of an actual apartment. To make matters worse, I had broken my knees and needed crutches to get around, so I couldn't even apply for most normal jobs. If I had bought anything I didn't actually need, I'd never have gotten out of poverty.

Instead, I spent all my time studying, looking for a (desk) job and finding new ways to reduce my expenses. And it worked; I got a job, and since I had studied so hard while I was still looking for a job, once I got into college, I managed to finish a three-year STEM degree within 10 months. In my case, poverty and stress increased my IQ, if anything, simply because it drove me to work that much harder to get out of the situation. 

That's why I advocate that everyone else do the same. It worked for me, and it will work for others as well, as long as they make the effort.",0.121411435,EMPTY,Bavio,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

One additional upside of being connected is that you can also sell excess power to the grid.  If a HOA is off-gid, then you have to shutdown your turbine when your battery is full, which effectively increases the cost per unit energy.

Our petrol price is roughly one third taxes and excise which makes the final product roughly 50% more expensive than it would otherwise be. If the oil was extracted in Australia then both state and federal royalties were paid by the petroleum producer which is also the case for gas or coal extracted here. None of these are subsidies and infact make the final products more expensive for consumers, ie, the polar opposite of a subsidy.

For example, if I look at a Tesla, the fuel cost saving/100klms is roughly 57% compared to an ICE powered car but would only be about 40% cheaper if excise on fuel was removed.

This is actually a large problem for government at the moment because as the electric car fleet expands, fewer motorists will be paying fuel excise.

1571135342.0,1571135352.7418845,f3tia1p,"A popular suggestion is that raising taxes only on high earners (for example, the top one percent – households that make above roughly $435,000 annually) would fix the debt problem. Although revenue from high earners could contribute to the solution, it is unlikely to be enough to fully solve our debt problems. This is particularly true if efforts to raise income from high earners come primarily from raising individual income tax rates.

To provide a generous estimate of the revenue that can be raised by increasing tax rates on higher earners, we extrapolated estimates for a 1 percentage point tax increase provided by the Congressional Budget Office. These numbers will significantly overstate the revenue potential of raising rates since they do not account for the large behavioral effects likely to occur as the top tax rises.

By our math, achieving a balanced budget by 2025 by raising the top two rates – those which only apply to income significantly above $400,000 – would require increasing the top individual tax rate from 39.6 percent to about 102 percent. This is an obvious impossibility, since few taxpayers would continue to work at a 100 percent tax rate.

A more modest goal of reducing deficits to their pre-recession historical average of about 2.2% of GDP (enough to put the debt on a modest downward path) would require a top rate of 65%. In reality, that would likely also be impossible as rates at that level would lead to significant (legal and illegal) tax avoidance strategies and lower work effort and labor force participation. In fact, based on estimates from liberal economists Peter Diamond and Emmanuel Saez, the revenue-maximizing individual income tax rate is likely about 63 percent (they estimate 73 percent including state, local, and Medicare taxes).

Expanding the set of taxpayers subject to a tax increase would make it easier to hit any given fiscal target. Balancing the budget only from households making above $250,000 would require a (still impossible) 90 percent top rate, but reducing deficits to 2.2 percent of GDP would require a 60 percent top rate and might be achievable. Expanding the universe to couples above $150,000 would reduce the needed top rate to 56 percent and applying the increase to all tax brackets would require a top rate of 43 percent – only 3½ point higher than today’s top rate.

And you are way wrong they pay way more taxes than you or I will ever pay.  You are being lied to with straight propaganda.  It's sickening frankly.

Most of these people's wealth is wrapped up in their own companies stocks that they started.  Those companies pay tons of taxes.  1 year that they used carried forward losses and you act like they've never paid them.

It's complete fucking propaganda that politicans are feeding you to try to create a mob mentality so they can take freedoms.  Amazon has stolen nothing from me.  They've provided amazing services that have made life for 100s of millions way better.

Microsoft has stolen nothing from me.. They launched the world into a way better place with tech.  Exxon hasn't stolen shit from me they have provided cheap electricity and power for our vehicles.

All while paying shit tons of taxes.  More than you could ever imagine.

How much more does the government need?  How much more will make Bernie happy??  Government spend 4 trillion per year.. PER FUCKING YEAR..  That extra couple hundred billion going to make him happy?? 

No he'll never be happy.. Politicians will always look for more ways to take from people.

Just because they are billionaires does not mean they do not have the same rights you and I have.  If we allow the government to seize assets we've completely lost our rights..

Politicians are the ones that are stealing form us.. not businesses.

“We may have already discovered the essence of life on Mars 40 years ago, according to a former NASA scientist.
Gilbert V. Levin, who was principal investigator on a NASA experiment that sent Viking landers to Mars in 1976, published an article in the Scientific American journal last Thursday, arguing the experiment's positive results were proof of life on the red planet.
The experiment, called Labeled Release (LR), was designed to test Martian soil for organic matter. ""It seemed we had answered that ultimate question,"" Levin wrote in the article.

In the experiment, the Viking probes placed nutrients in Mars soil samples -- if life were present, it would consume the food and leave gaseous traces of its metabolism, which radioactive monitors would then detect.
To make sure it was a biological reaction, the test was repeated after cooking the soil, which would prove lethal to known life. If there was a measurable reaction in the first and not the second sample, that would suggest biological forces at work -- and that's exactly what happened, according to Levin.
However, other experiments failed to find any organic material and NASA couldn't duplicate the results in their laboratory -- so they dismissed the positive result as false positives, some unknown chemical reaction rather than proof of extraterrestrial life.

""NASA concluded that the LR had found a substance mimicking life, but not life,"" said Levin in his article. ""Inexplicably, over the 43 years since Viking, none of NASA's subsequent Mars landers has carried a life detection instrument to follow up on these exciting results.""
But now, decades later, there are more and more promising signs. NASA's Curiosity rover found organic matter on Mars in 2018, and just last week it found sediments that suggest there were once ancient salty lakes on the surface of Mars.”",0.113228455,EMPTY,shaka_zulu12,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

If someone was asserting a 'God-given' / 'natural' right that the government didn't recognise, they wouldn't be depriving you of those rights. This is because as far as that jurisdiction (and by implication society) are concerned, those rights don't exist. That's not to say that all governments reflect the will of the people they govern, of course. 

Example: some in the US posit that the right to bear arms is a god-given / natural right, as opposed to a particular facet of their constitution and legal framework. This would imply that it is a universal human right. Making that argument in the US is fine, because the US government accepts and upholds that right anyway. 

If that US individual was to take their firearm to the UK and make the same argument, their gun would be confiscated and they'd be arrested (unless they were subject to some very narrow licensing requirements).

There are two things you need to protect against:

1. Managers raiding the salaries of employees to get a bonus should be avoided at all cost. I would exclude savings by salary or position reduction altogether from this reward system. There may be extreme and very specific examples where I might be fine with this, but it'd have to be a very coherent setup that is aimed at reducing wholly wasteful positions or exorbitant salaries and not just turning a team into a skeleton crew and skyrocketing turnover rates.

2. The quality and quantity of services should not be reduced. So in order to qualify for the bonus you'd need to show the service being provided now compared to the service being provided later and show no downgrade there. A failure to provide the service should be a pretty dang big black mark on the manager and that should be made absolutely clear to them up-front. From my experience in just the health care administration, there's millions in savings at even just the state level just by switching up vendors and sometimes the new vendors are not only cheaper but a lot better. There are medically necessary devices we're paying for that are 80's old and still getting five figures each that can be replaced by modern technology with no problem.

3. I think an overall budgetary bonus should be considered at the end of the year. If you as an agency come in under budget then I'm perfectly fine seeing part of that distributed across employees with clear rules on what to do with the remaining excess (a portion should go into rainy day funds and I'd like to see the government start to be comfortable getting refunds for them to save or spend accordingly, like against our debt for example). This would hopefully reward decision makers for picking more fiscally reasonable vendors.

I guess distilling things down to 'rights come from the government' is ultimately an abstraction of the broader concept that rights are defined and enforced societally by whichever group has been granted (or seized) the monopoly on state violence. 

In most modern settings that's shorthand for government, and in democracies that's a workable system because governments should be composed of and representative of the people they govern. In that kind of democratic environment, the implication is also that the rights government grant are based on the broader societal consensus. 

I suppose what I'm angling at is that rights are defined and enforced by those with the power to do so. In most environments that will be democratically-steered governments - in failed states, autocracies or anarchies it'll be whoever can compel or coerce the most people.

If you are locking in profits, the bank is taking on the upside and the downside risk of your business performance. That is the equity risk. The bank doesn't have control of the board, but they get all of the profits (or losses). Which creates a bunch of crazy incentives for everyone involved.

The logic is so simple that even a smart 5th grader could understand it, so it's very discouraging that adults in positions of power do not: we need to reduce our impact on the planet by about 80% in order to become genuinely sustainable, and if we did that by cutting back economic activity (i.e. consumption and production), then that would equate to an 80% reduction in GDP. You may recall that a 5% reduction in GDP caused the Great Recession in 2007, and a 25% caused the Great Depression. And those were temporary. A permanent 80% reduction would end our civilization and turn every country in the world into the equivalent of Somalia or Bangladesh.

So, since we're not going to eradicate 80% of the world's population and reduce our impact that way, the only alternative is clean technology. And technology really can do the job for us.

But, if technology can solve 80% of the problem, it can solve 90%, 95%, and 99% too. Since technology can do the whole job, there is no *practical* reason to demand a reduction in personal quality of life. The only remaining reason is a moralistic one: a ""good"" person should sacrifice, should suffer, should feel guilty for having a nice life while is still poverty in the world, etc.

That is not a useless reason. There is some truth to the idea that the world is far, far too inequitable. But the solution isn't to drag everyone with a good life down. The solution is to lift everyone in poverty UP. And we can do that too - with technology. In fact, we've been doing [a pretty good job of it already](https://www.vox.com/future-perfect/2019/2/12/18215534/bill-gates-global-poverty-chart).

Ultimately, it just isn't very helpful to have a lot of sanctimonious preaching about the sinfulness and decadence of having a modern quality of life from people who are themselves privileged beneficiaries of the system that produced that prosperity.

It is much better to simply focus on developing better tools with which to solve the social and environmental problems we face. And we can do it, because we're inventing better and better tools every day. It's extremely foolish and shortsighted to argue that we should give up because of climate change when after more than 50 years we finally have one foot across the finish line with clean energy beating fossil fuels on a level economic playing field.

They run our campgrounds, they run the restaurants, they run the visitor center store, and they rent the goddamn jet skis that zip all over the lake scaring wildlife and destroying any sense of serenity the place might offer. Our prices for admission continuously rise and once you’re in the park, there’s many other cash grabs waiting for you. 

The selling out of our national parks to private interests has been happening for a long time and it’s been coupled with stagnating funding for the park service system-wide. They might not always sell off the land itself, but they sacrifice it in other ways. The sad thing is, it’s that most people seem to want. People wait for hours to get in our park. It’s a safe and easy way to enjoy the outdoors. 

Here’s the National Park Service mission: 

“The National Park Service is dedicated to conserving unimpaired the natural and cultural resources and values of the National Park System for the enjoyment, education, and inspiration of this and future generations.”

There’s an inherent tension there between “enjoyment” and “conserving unimpaired” because when millions of people want to “enjoy” it every year (which means renting boats and atv’s from private contractors, gorging themselves on cheap food and beer, burning immense amounts of fuel, camping of every inch of shoreline, etc).. well the impairment of the resource follows quickly after. 

I’m not sure what the solution is but it may be to slash the deals we’ve got with private companies and force people to enjoy these places in a more primitive fashion.

A few suggestions:

- skyscrapers. Urbanites and their beloved skylines have become a huge problem. Giant glass buildings with no insulation that leave their lights on all night and require huge amounts of air conditioning are terrible for emissions. They need to be dismantled. They also use a lot of steel and concrete, two of the most polluting substances to make. 

- Fly a lot less. Self-explanatory. See the world through VR goggles, or fast electrified trains, not a massive carbon footprint. Live in your local area, and get around in an EV.

- Eat less meat. This one has been widely discussed so no need to explain. 

- End globalisation. Shipping industries to highly polluting, poorly regulated and corrupt countries is killing the planet. China has 226ghz of new coalfired power stations planned, in order to make stuff for us. This will kill the planet. Shipping goods huge distances on massive freighters is also deadly.

(And please, please God do not send me one of those idiots who has been brainwashed by the industry in to believing that local goods are somehow worse for the environment.)

Trouble is, a lot of people who claim to care about climate change are precisely the sort of people who like to brag about how often they fly to other countries, and who love living in cities with skyscrapers because it makes them feel sophisticated, and who loudly support globalisation.

Yikes. I've gotten used to your ad hominems by now but this really hurt me man :'(

If you really wanted me to continue to argue in good faith then maybe you should've also done so from the beginning. I honestly should've stopped responding after you brought up your guess on my views about 9/11.

And btw I was hoping for something more credible than the tic tac case, there's really not much we can get from it. Just from the wiki:

>Physicist Don Lincoln suggested that it was ""very unlikely that what these pilots are reporting turns out to be an unfriendly superweapon or an alien craft,""

>Science journalist Dennis Overbye argued a ""stubborn residue"" of unexplained aerial phenomena remain after review. Overbye highlighted that some of these accounts are obtained from respected observers such as military pilots. However, he cautioned, ""as modern psychology and neuroscience have established, the senses are an unreliable portal to reality, whatever that is.""

>According to Steve Cummings of Raytheon Space and Airborne Systems, the video images captured by a Raytheon-made Advanced Targeting Forward-Looking Infrared (ATFLIR) sensor are not definitive proof that the jet pilots were chasing an actual UFO. Cummings noted, ""To really be sure, we would need the raw data. Visual displays alone are not the best evidence""

>former Air Force pilot James E. McGaha speculated that reports of churning water could have been caused by a submerging submarine, the visual sightings could have been of a reconnaissance drone, and that ""one video image showing an object suddenly zooming off screen was likely caused by the plane's banking while the camera was stopped at the end of its sweep""

>Nickell also notes that the incident had apparently not been considered serious enough to warrant a debriefing of either Fravor, the other pilots, or the radar operator.

Sorry if I value expert opinions over yours. When I asked for evidence I was looking for something that had no reasonable explanations, something that doesn't have a dozen other natural explanations. If you had something that couldn't be explained away by common sense I would be a lot more interested, because then I could actually think about it and try to figure out how it would be possible with my current understanding of the world (for my own pleasure). If you hadn't realized already I don't actually think there's any evidence out there that is good enough to take your theory seriously, and seeing as the tic tac case is your best example it's obvious you don't have anything either (what's the difference between the tic tac footage and the multitude of other debunked cases?)

That's true - that's the benefit.  The trade-off is that you might get substantially worse care than you would if you were covered under a good insurance plan in the US.

> should I call an ambulance, potentially saddling this person with a massive bill

Ambulance bills are not *that* expensive.  If you have to *think about it* because the cost of ~$500 *might* not be covered, then just drive the person to the hospital.  Ambulances should really only be used for life-death situations- not general hospital transport.

> there are wait times in the U.S., even with ""good"" insurance. 

Not even in the same ballpark.  I might wait for a month or two in the US to see a specialist.   In Canada, you might wait a year or more.  Wait times in Quebec even for GPs are literally 18 months - that's not an exaggeration.

> This makes the system much more inefficient 

You have not experienced inefficiency until you've experienced a government run health system.   It's something you can only understand through living through it.  

The life experiences of myself and my family are more than just an ""anecdote"".  I would never ever want what we had in Canada - now that we can AFFORD good healthcare because of our corporate coverage.

Uh, citation needed. You were complaining about waits, now it's the quality of care? Literally the only difference between now vs m4a is who pays, all the doctors and procedures stay the same...

>Ambulance bills are not that expensive. If you have to think about it because the cost of ~$500 might not be covered, then just drive the person to the hospital. Ambulances should really only be used for life-death situations- not general hospital transport. 

Okay, if you think ""$500 is not that expensive"" then congratulations, you're better off than a majority of Americans. Most of the working population can't handle a sudden $200 expense, much less $500, and TBH *I'm pretty sure you're lowballing it here*. 

>Not even in the same ballpark. I might wait for a month or two in the US to see a specialist. In Canada, you might wait a year or more. Wait times in Quebec even for GPs are literally 18 months - that's not an exaggeration.  

And yet I've read hundreds, if not thousands, of comments to the contrary- that wait times for necessary procedures are fairly short and other wait times are comparable to those in the U.S. 

>The life experiences of myself and my family are more than just an ""anecdote"". I would never ever want what we had in Canada - now that we can AFFORD good healthcare because of our corporate coverage.

Your life experiences are literally, by definition, anecdotal experiences. In contrast to if you had statistical data like indicating that waits for GP visits average 18 months+. 

Also this attitude is basically taking for granted that if you have shorter waits and better care it comes at the expense of others who can receive NO treatment. Maybe you're king of the crab pile, doesn't make the system any better just because you benefit relative to others. 

>But if you are working in the US and have employer based coverage, it is always better. 

My employer provided healthcare is so shitty that I can't even afford to use it. Most people can't afford deductibles in the multiple thousands of dollars on top of premiums, copays, pharmacy costs, and that's even assuming the insurance company doesn't try to deny coverage. 

Also want to point out that if your *good* healthcare is tied to employment, congratulations- so are you. Maybe in the future you'll get a new boss who makes your life miserable. Are you going to be so happy with your care when you have to weigh the needs of a chronically ill family member against your happiness at work?  Are you going to risk looking for new work and potentially losing coverage which you or a loved one NEED to survive? Probably not. And good luck if for some reason you're fired or otherwise lose your job. 

Universal healthcare would give every American worker more bargaining power, because they can finally say ""no"" without fear of losing their healthcare and dying. Those same workers would also have greater leverage to negotiate higher wages, since their employer would no longer be covering it. 

In any case, you want the rich taxed and Bernie is the only one in the race who will do so aggressively and so can be relied on to actually struggle for it. He's not gonna get in office and jack up your taxes and leave the rich untouched, because unlike every other politician in America his campaign isn't funded by (and consequently beholden to the interests of) the rich.

Gun control. Guns are not the problem. “Kids are dying in schools because of guns.” Well, kids are also dying at a much higher rate actually the leading cause of death from texting and driving. So, let’s ban the use of phones from people 21 and younger. Oh wait, it’s not the phone it’s the user. Just as it’s not the gun it’s the user. 

Car wrecks kill more people than guns ever could in a year but we still allow those. The solution can not be the item itself it is the education of the user not to abuse said item that we must deem important. 

Taxing people up to 70 percent for her stupid new green deal. 

She wants to get rid of ICE and the Department of Homeland Security. 

She’s a socialist. So, basically I should pay for everyone else’s standard of living because I’m in a higher tax bracket. That’s what it boils down to. You can argue that all day. Go dig deep into what she is really saying though. 

Her basic understanding of economics is slim at best. Watch her talk on the subject. I don’t feel like I need to dig into that anymore, either. 

She ran Amazon out of New York. Why? Pretty much everyone agrees that was bad. 

I mean the list goes on and on. She’s a moron. 

She won’t get re-elected. She’s made a fool of herself on numerous occasions. Everything sounds “okay” at best on paper but nothing she wants to implement will work. 

Also, Climate Change is ridiculous. What we as humans do to the earth is a drop in the bucket. 
The earth fluctuates over 1000s of years. The sun is about to go into a cooling spell as well. So, I disagree that we are actually doing so much damage to the environment. 

Now, as a species I do believe we an obligation to create cleaner energy just because we have the ability to do so. We should always be moving forward in technology. Imagine if we had the means to move out of the Stone Age and decided not to. Same thing. 

I don’t want an electric car because I love new Silverado but, at the end of the day if they created an electric truck that did the same thing I’d buy it. 

If we really want to tackle climate change that’s apparently dooming us all let’s go after China. They are huge in the pollution game. Also, most of the plastic in the ocean comes from like three rivers in Asia or Africa. Don’t quote me on the exact number or place. You can source that yourself and see directly what I’m referring to. 

Anyways, I don’t even know why I have to say she’s an idiot. I think Dems and Republicans alike think she’s a freaking looney tune.

Gasoline-engined vehicles are still going to have a pretty significant hobby scene, probably fed by gasoline-ethanol fuel blends. The hard part is going to be in figuring out a single octane-rating of fuel that all of the older gasoline engines are going to run on relatively well together. However, I would wager that spark-ignited engines are on their way out; they can't compete from an emissions or efficiency perspective on the light-duty end with EVs, and on the heavy-duty end they'll stop being nearly as competitive against diesels if/when CO2 and GHGs become regulated emissions, either through raised fuel economy standards, or through a straight tax on CO2 emitted per mile.

Diesels will still be utilized, and diesel fuel (or rather, some renewable equivalent) will still be widely available. EVs won't make much sense for long-haul over-the-road freight, particularly in comparison to diesel-electric hybrids. Further, even if there isn't diesel, there will be kerosene and jet fuel, both of which can work in diesel engines with minimal (bordering on zero) need to retune the engines.

It may get harder to get some replacement components, but I'd wager (at least in the US) that where will be a number of machinists and auto shops that specialize in manufacturing ICE vehicle components.

In Texas I literally have to use my car every time I want to do anything. Most everyone in the city where I live spends an hour a day in their car. To not have a car in a city in Texas puts you at a serious disadvantage. 

In Italy I have a car but it's not unusual for it to go unused for periods long enough to spoil the fuel. I practically never need it. Almost everything I need to do is easier done on foot, or foot+train. In fact the car is really a bit of a waste, I could probably save money by just renting a car when I really need it. 

The guy you're replying to is right. The reason for the difference is because the city in Texas was literally planned post WWII under the assumption that people will use cars for everything, whereas the city in Italy was literally fully mature centuries before cars were invented, so it's organized completely around the human, not the car.

Watch a new American housing subdivision go up. Look how it's planned.

But, at the same time, do we *really* have to sacrifice so much? We do need to stop with all the single use plastics and such, but, when it comes to things like AC, driving, etc - that can be more easily solved. Switch all energy to solar, wind, nuclear, etc. things with little to no carbon footprint, things that are renewable (or efficient enough to last until energy storage is solved, in the case of nuclear). Switch all cars to electric. Boom - you can now drive your cars, crank up the AC, etc without worrying about your power usage causing tons of CO2.

The coming conflicts are going to be driven by the same underlying cause; the global order established in 1944 is coming to an end, entirely because it's no longer in the interests of the US to maintain it. Thus, the US will gradually withdraw from the global stage, and because no one is capable of filling the power vacuum, wars of trade routes, over resources, and over ideologies that *normally* would have been either put out or kept in check by American involvement have a *real* potential to spin out of control.

This isn't a new line of though, either. It's been a mainstay of some geopolitical analysis such as [Peter Zeihan](https://youtu.be/feU7HT0x_qU?t=44), who have been calling this for years. And we're *already* seeing it beginning to play out. The US is withdrawing from Syria, but this is masking a much greater withdrawal from the Middle East writ-large. American troop levels in the region are a *tenth* of their all-time highs during the height of the War on Terror. Put another way, troop levels in Afghanistan are higher than the entire rest of the region *combined*...and the US has already committed to leaving Afghanistan, to the degree that it is quite willing to negotiate an agreement with the Taliban.

That isn't good for the rest of the world. A lot of the global shipping lanes, through which the food, energy, and resources that allow us to continue our modern international society, are guarded by the US. The scary one is the Strait of Hormuz, through which flows 20% of global crude oil shipments (and, incidentally, 75% of China's oil supply), and which sits between two nations and cultures that have been at odds over ethnic, religious, sectarian, economic, political, and other such issues for *millennia*, and which are yet again on the brink of conflict with each other.

Add on top of this the fact that the US withdrawal from Syria has put the Russians in a strange situation; they're now the only party capable of holding the Turks and the Syrians apart, but they'd much rather not have to do it because they're also more than a little banged up from what they've been doing in Syria thus far. The US is bailing, and honestly it may be in Russia's best interests to do the same, at which point there is nothing to stop Turkey from flexing its muscles not only against the Kurds, but against all of Syria.

It is *not* looking good for the Middle East, and without some providing tens of thousands of peacekeepers throughout the entire region, it's almost certainly going to spin out of control *somewhere*.",0.23387621,EMPTY,r3dl3g,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

1571160265.0,1571160282.7521834,f3uh54u,"One of the main things currently holding back electric vehicles (other than the lack of charging points obviously) are the lack of standardised design (requiring a wider range of parts) and the current reliance on third party battery providers (many of whom are struggling to keep up with the growing demand). However that’s likely to change in the next few years, I would say, 

Speaking of just VW which is currently trying very hard to become a market leader in electric vehicles, they’re rolling out their new extremely simplified, very standardised new car MEB “platform”- essentially the underlying structure the body is stuck to- which is versatile enough to be used for a range of vehicles from small runarounds to minivans. Which means that no matter what model in that range it is, it can be easily understood and repaired in the same way. Which was a massive advantage that ICE vehicles had over electric for a long time. I believe they’re currently in talks with Ford about the possibility that they might also adopt the same platform, meaning even more cars will have that design in future. Beyond that, a smaller range of needed parts means a lower manufacturing cost and lower repair cost. That is one of the biggest things that will bring costs down on electrics, as well as making them far more desirable for leasing (which is a growing way that people choose to “own” cars nowadays). 

Beyond that, VW (and I’m sure other companies are probably also considering it) are creating a battery manufacturer specifically for their cars, which allows them to lower costs between the battery supplier and their car factory. It also allows them to be independent of the current limitations of third party battery manufacturers whose demand is limited by the wide range of batteries being demanded of them- and allowing for faster growth in production. 

All in all I wouldn’t be surprised if by about 2022, electric cars start to be seen at similar prices to ICE ones, and then with things like carbon taxes, congestion charges, rising fuel costs and government incentives to buy electric, you might just see fairly fast adoption across a lot of countries, particularly as “second cars” for short journeys.",0.07028077,EMPTY,Gauntlets28,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Will you be convinced with evidence? Here is the investigation I was thinking of, it was done by ProPublica: [https://www.propublica.org/article/ultrawealthy-taxes-irs-internal-revenue-service-global-high-wealth-audits](https://www.propublica.org/article/ultrawealthy-taxes-irs-internal-revenue-service-global-high-wealth-audits)

The problem, ultimately, is that it's too expensive and resource intensive to go after the ultra-rich for tax evasion. For an underfunded and under-staffed agency like the IRS, returns are actually greater from instead focusing on lower-income evaders, because they are much easier to audit. I realize it's difficult to elicit sympathy for the IRS from Americans, but unfortunately that's the sad state of our country right now.

The objection from libertarian-minded types to the proposed wealth taxes is always ""well why don't we just follow existing rules first."" But the reality of the situation is that without massive investment and political support it is simply not possible for the IRS to go after the ultra rich to the same extent that they go after the poor. Weirdly, none of these libertarian types seem willing to actually support the IRS either, which makes me think they are not arguing in good faith.

As I said before, if you are not bringing serious solutions to the table, then please just keep quiet.

Assuming catastrophic failure dropping the solar foo onto the cars, that's 300 lbs dropping onto the roof of a car just in panels. That doesn't consider the weight of the structure needed to hold up those panels. Clearance needs to be 14 feet for shipping trucks, so that weight is dropping 9 feet before hitting the car roof. That's a significant amount of force from a direction that cars are not designed to withstand. We are likely to see additional injuries from such an event. Once it's at rest, more of the vehicle will support it than just the roof of the passenger compartment, but the initial impact is going to have all that force hitting a thin bit of steel and glass.

It's also a hell of a cleanup issue that stops that lane of traffic dead for the duration. One sedan-sized section of roof caving in from a sleepy driver veering off road and taking out supports shuts that lane down until a work crew can come out and remove hundreds of pounds of debris.

Just by way of example, here's a video of what this could look like. It's a non-fatal accident involving a not worst case scenario with current road signs. Said signs are lighter than solar panels, and the impact had less force than the situation I'm describing above. The passenger side of the car is completely crushed, and had there been someone on that side, they would have been seriously injured or killed.

Yup.  So the ""electoral outcome"" is the same if a candidate wins a state by a large margin -- or a small margin.  If your candidate wins CA by five million votes, and your opponent wins a handful of smaller states by razor-thin margins, your opponent could win the election while still losing by millions of votes.

> Capitalism’s failures arise from two of its defining elements. The first is perpetual growth. Economic growth is the aggregate effect of the quest to accumulate capital and extract profit. Capitalism collapses without growth, yet perpetual growth on a finite planet leads inexorably to environmental calamity.

> A system based on perpetual growth cannot function without peripheries and externalities. There must always be an extraction zone – from which materials are taken without full payment – and a disposal zone, where costs are dumped in the form of waste and pollution. As the scale of economic activity increases until capitalism affects everything, from the atmosphere to the deep ocean floor, the entire planet becomes a sacrifice zone: we all inhabit the periphery of the profit-making machine.

The only reason those nations don't pollute more in CO2 is strictly due to their lack of access to vehicles and the fact that they haven't fully industrialized. Those numbers will change a lot once they do. India is industrializing quickly. But it's a little skewed and odd to think they won't start grossly producing CO2 in vast quantities once they get cars... It's also a bit perverse to assume that because they aren't producing now that they never will. A lack of vehicles is a huge factor in this.

But in regards to total pollution (not just CO2) they can actually contribute with? Yea, they are far worse than ""richer"" nations. By a landslide.",0.22027704,EMPTY,atlasunchained,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Obamacare is a fully privatized system with no public option, and the Dems were called Socialists and Communists for passing what is objectively a Right of center healthcare plan. 


Obama and the dems also:
- continued Bush's extrajudicial drone strike program (with a higher death toll), murdering 1,000s of civilians, thereby continuing the US's streak of committing war crimes. 
- Oversaw and supported the NSA national spying program (remember that Edward Snowden?) 
- He deported more undocumented immigrants than Bush (a higher % were criminals, but still for comparison sake)
- Prosecuted more whistleblowers for espionage than all administrations before him. 
- Started and supported the conflict in Yemen which has turned into a forced famine/genocide situation. 
- Bailed out the banks to the tune of trillions of dollars in practically free money (<0.25% int), prosecuted almost no bankers or CEOS (for reference 1,000s were criminally prosecuted following the S&L crisis under Republican presidents). He didn't exactly support Occupy Wallstreet.
- The Dodd-Frank the ""hallmark"" Finanicial reform, which was weaker than financial regulations repealed by Clinton and the Dems in the 90's, had less than 50% of it's regulations enacted, and has been delayed and severely amended. 
- When Scott Walker and his billionaire friends wanted to (and did)crush unions in Wisconsin, Obama, who said he would 'grab his sneakers and walk the picket line' with union members during his campaign, was silent and nowhere to be seen. 
- The vast majority of Democrats voted for the Iraq and Afghanistan wars, as well as the Patriot Acts and its renewal.

But this problem has a surprisingly simple solution. It turns out, the worst thing about being jobless isn't losing the job, it's losing your income. If you can pay your rent, and buy some food, having to look for a new job isn't so bad!

So before we go around stomping out naughty sectors of industry: we have to grant a universal basic income, calibrated to what the productive capacity of the economy can respond to. Inflation? Too much basic income. No inflation? Room for more. Raise it either to the limits of what inflation will allow, or to what is sufficient to make unemployment comfortable. Now, unlike before, the government can tune down whatever jobs it wants. Some simple price management from there can take care of the rest.

Let's say we remove subsidies for fishing industry. Some fisheries close down. Price of fish goes up in some areas. Well, those who like fish but can't afford the price hike, will start eating something else instead-- demand will channel into an area of the economy that can respond with more supply. And who knows-- maybe we can get the government to subsidize meat substitutes, or sustainable agriculture instead? Something that *doesn't* destroy the environment by becoming cheaper?

Simple economics-- what's scarce (non-sustainable) should be expensive. What's abundant (sustainable) should be cheap. Up until now, we've simply used the state to monkey the levers in the wrong direction. What did we expect would happen?

Price management itself will go a long way. But that can't happen more aggressively until we have a basic income, the primary purpose of which is to make unemployment an enjoyable detour in life, instead of an existential crisis. Right now, we manage prices with one goal: to keep everybody employed.

To say that someone making 100k creates twice as much carbon footprint as someone making 50k makes a lot of assumptions.  If people spent everything they made on consumables, that could be true.  But:

1)Taxes are significantly higher on someone making 100k, so the percentage of that money people keep is a lot lower.

2)People tend to spend a large portion of their income on housing, if they make more money they buy a nicer house, but a bigger factor in housing is location.  People that make more would have a higher percentage of living centrally to things they do (work, play, etc).  This is less mileage driven daily.  

3)People with more money will most likely have a higher percentage of newer cars, which are much more efficient.  In the poorer areas of my city, that are further from the center, people are driving old busted ass SUVs, Pontiac v8s etc, cars with black smoke coming out of them.

4) People that make more money are more apt to put it in retirement for savings down the road.  If you are living paycheck to paycheck, you are spending everything.

The EU has about half of that per capita and is at about rank 50 when it comes to pollution (out of 214). Cut that in half and you have the pollution per capita of Mexico. 

Half of that, Vietnam. 

Half of that, Pakistan. 

Countries on the bottom of the list, like Rwanda, Somalia, Niger, Mali, Kongo, Uganda,.. have an emission of about 0.1 tons of CO2 per capita. The US has 17.

Will this mean that privacy will not be a priority for the next generation?  Will privacy become a thing of the past?  Will the loss of anonymity force accountability, or will it all become noise?

Fear mongering helps no one, and only through multiple investments in the field of science and research will help anything.
Even if FTL isn't viable, the research that comes from it could be exceptionally useful in other fields. Remember... We didn't exactly figure out half of what we know as a race intentionally. Quite a few times it was sheer incident because we were pursuing something else 
Think about a new renewable power source made possible by this research. If we could developer one efficient enough to out do major power plants we'd make things exceptionally easier to get rid of coal. If we end up developing a new form of transportation that efficiently and effectively uses electricity we could begin removing even more poison from our environment.
Of course that's one area. Now think of colonization. If we are able to find a planet with life on it, we might be able to find an organism that only devours certain chemical structures. Currently we have one on earth, but imagine if we could introduce a species that couldn't interact with our own. While, still being able to remove plastic and waste from our oceans and environments. We could push forwards and even make new medicines.
There is SO much we could gain from this research and the possibilities are limitless.

First of all power isn't inherently bad: we need power literacy by the right people who understand contemporary important problems, the merit of science and who don't care about money. Then there can be a systemic structure that manages how power is claimed/allocated in another way, different accountability mechanisms and which largely gets rid of it by being based on the scientific method and open participation.

It's a flawed socioeconomic system and only partly human nature. Humans built this structure so it would be myopic to say it's not human nature. But there are many systems we can build, we can change (and have done so many times). Patchfixing a broken system won't work. But maybe some such measures could at least buy some time and help the transition. So for example if you measure carbon emissions for products for a carbon tax this measurement and monitoring system can be used for more holistic and effective solutions later.

Secondly, I never shifted from my position. When you compare rich people vs poor people, poor people pollute more than rich people. That's just a fact. And there's a decent reason behind it: Environmental concern is a luxury good. Poor people don't have the luxury to give a shit about the ozone layer or about the filth around them. That's something you start to care about after you've maintained a decent quality of life. Hence why most of the people concerned with environmental problems tend to be kids wealthy enough to go to college.

And they do pollute more per capita. What you are doing is taking very specific ""aggregates"" and claiming that they don't as a result of cherry picking. There is more to pollution than CO2, and if you want to talk about CO2 emissions you can't begin to do that until you isolate the capability to produce CO2.

That'd be like comparing US gun rates to a country without guns and claiming that the people are less violent because they shoot people less. Which would be ridiculous because ""violence"" and ""gun violence"" aren't equal, one is a specific type of violence. This is basically what you're doing, you're taking CO2 pollution and claiming that's basically the whole pollution story. Yet that's so far from the truth that it's sad to even continue this conversation.

A big problem in AI today is that the AI cannot explain why it came to the results it did. In some cases, that's okay. If you ask an AI to generate an image using the style from one image and the content of another, the question of ""why"" it created what it did does not seem very relevant. But it does seem very relevant in the case of medical diagnoses. If an AI says the data indicates a person has cancer and must undergo very difficult cancer treatment, I think all the human stakeholders will want to know why and double-check the AI's conclusions.

For general inquiry, I think humans prefer synoptic explanations of how things work. We're hardcoded to prefer universal/general rules because they make life easier but also we have an aesthetic attraction to elegant simplicity. While I think it could very well be the case that AI overtakes humans as the dominant ""life form"" on this planet, if it were up to us humans, we'd probably want control. And having control means having the power to understand and explain things. 

It might be a useful exercise to review the arguments for/against [computer-assisted proofing in mathematics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Computer-assisted_proof#Philosophical_objections).

Shift car production today to more and more electric. People will naturally change over as time goes on. Meanwhile as more people start using electric, start introducing more charging stations at places like malls, large government buildings, etc. places with lots of parking and traffic. One step at a time.

The meat thing could be done really any time. Cut subsidies on cattle farms and start subsidizing lab grown meats or meat replacements like the “impossible” meats. As regular beef becomes more expensive and lab grown beef or beef replacements become cheaper, people will switch naturally. Tell cattle farmers if they want to receive higher subsidies they need to invest in greener practices - such as feeding cows food they can actually digest properly to cut down on methane release.

It’s that we’ve allowed the rich to essentially control the government through lobbying, bribes, blackmail and such. People who say it’s all because of capitalism are a little naive. The problem is we as a people don’t do enough to police our government to make sure they’re doing things for the people, and not just the rich.

Power and wealth corrupt. It’s just human nature to want *more*. It makes sense really - when resources are scarce, doing whatever you can to get *more* ensures survival. Problem is, civilization has evolved past the need for that. But it’s still present inside us. That’s why eventually any body of power will eventually look after itself instead of others. We need to set these systems up so this can’t happen, and be more active when it does.

But right now Americans just don’t have the time or energy to be active. Most are just trying to get by. We’ve sort of trapped ourselves in this system, and it’s going to take a pretty big change to fix it.

This has nothing to do with mind reading, or even with me guessing what individuals will do. I can't tell you what Warren Buffet or Charles Koch are going to do. I have no idea. This is me explaining what the ideal capitalist would do. There are very few of them in real life, but there are many people that, to varying degrees, attempt to emulate that behaviour, whether they do so consciously or not. In aggregate they are essentially the ""Capitalists"" and their actions bear this out.  

This is in the same way that right wing economists love to talk about individual economic actors via their favorite ideal ""Entrepreneur."" Do you also want to say that they don't know how to read minds, too ? Because they don't know what individuals are going to do either, they make their approximations based on that ideal actor, just as I have done here. And some of their ideas are borne out in how the market operates, just as some of the actions of the ideal Capitalist I have spoke of are also borne out.  

As far labor valuation per person goes, it is, as you have said, not the same, but I have made no attempt to talk about the individual valuation of labor because ultimately it is not decided wholly on that level. A person can have many different ideas about how to value labor but those ideas are not treated in isolation. Person A can demand whatever wage they want, thinking the value of their labor is X, but if an employer can find a Person B who thinks it is X-5%, they'll go with that person instead, and now Person A must revise their opinion with an eye toward agreeing with society.  

And there's nothing wrong with valuing profit off Capital, but I can take issue in two important regards. One, it becomes an issue if a small number are claiming all that profit for themselves. I do not argue against the profit, but its distribution. And two, there does seem to be a rather serious problem developing with the climate and it does seem that certain actors are pursuing personal profit in manners that are worsening that crisis, and so I think it's perfectly moral to say that such ways of making profit, should in fact, not be valued.",0.07760792,EMPTY,usaaf,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Anyone could sniff your passwords, credit card numbers, bank account details, etc.; and even the government recognizes that as an unrealistic situation.

There are basically five broad encryption scenarios worth discussing, and the government only really cares about ending three of them. (Not saying that they should end them.)

**Scenario 1:** You use Facebook messenger (in its default mode of operation) to send a message to a friend. This message is encrypted by your device, and sent to a Facebook server. Facebook decrypts your message, re-encrypts it and then sends it to your friend who then decrypts it. This is **encrypted in transit,** because a random person can't snoop on your message as it makes its way to your friend. However, it is **not end-to-end encrypted,** because one ""end"" of the conversation is you and the other ""end"" is your friend. But Facebook decrypts it in the middle, and can see what you sent, store it, and so on. So if you're Rudy Giuliani and plotting some insane Ukrainian shakedown, and the police go to Facebook asking for their help investigating you, Facebook can probably turn over your communications.

**Scenario 2:** You use WhatsApp to send a message to a friend. This message is encrypted\* by your device, and sent to an Facebook server, who sends it to your friend. Facebook doesn't -- and can't -- decrypt your message; they just pass it along to your friend. This is **end-to-end encrypted,** because one ""end"" of the conversation is you and the other ""end"" is your friend. Facebook doesn't, and can't, see what you sent. So if you're Rudy Giuliani and plotting some insane Ukrainian shakedown, and the police go to Facebook asking for their help investigating you, Facebook can't help them much. But they can tell the police who you were talking to, so they could seize your devices, which brings you to...

**Scenario 3:** Your iPhone has a record of your WhatsApp messages, meaning anyone who unlocks your iPhone has access to the fact that you're Rudy Giuliani and plotting some insane Ukrainian shakedown. But what if they can't unlock your phone? Well, they could take the storage device out, but they would find that the data is **encrypted at rest.** They can't see the contents of your iPhone without getting the key. Your device is the only place that has the key; Apple doesn't. And the only way to access the key is by guessing your passcode or using your Face ID to unlock the phone. This made the news a few years ago, when Apple couldn't help the authorities decrypt an iPhone belonging to a shooter.

**Scenario 4:** You're Rudy Giuliani and use Google Docs to plot some insane Ukrainian shakedown. Your notes are encrypted by your device, and sent to a Google server. Google decrypts your message, re-encrypts it and then stores it on their servers. However, Google has the key to decrypt the message stored on their servers. This is **end-to-end encrypted,** because one ""end"" of the conversation is you and the other ""end"" is Google. However, it's **not client-side encrypted**, because Google's servers are the ones that can decrypt the data. So if you're Rudy Giuliani and plotting some insane Ukrainian shakedown, and the police go to Google asking for their help investigating you, Google can probably turn over your notes.

**Scenario 5:** You're Rudy Giuliani, and use a service like Tresorit for plotting some insane Ukrainian shakedown. Your notes are encrypted by your device and then sent to Tresorit. But Tresorit can't decrypt your notes -- only your device can. This is **client-side encrypted.**

Basically, the government doesn't like Scenario 2, 3 and 5 because the only way they can investigate the fact that you're Rudy Giuliani and plotting some insane Ukrainian shakedown is by being in physical possession of your device (or, in scenario 2, your friend's device).

Scenario 1 and 4 are basically what good old-fashioned Internet communication uses, be it with your bank, Reddit, Google and Facebook. The government is more or less cool with these because they can always go to Google/Facebook/etc. for assistance.

Scenario 2 is becoming more significant with the rise of iMessage, WhatsApp and other end-to-end encrypted messaging services, and is an increasing concern for authorities. And of course, Scenario 3 is relevant to anyone who has a smartphone.

Scenario 5 isn't in wide use yet.

\*Yes, throughout this entire post I am ignoring the role of TLS in scenarios 2 and 5. I don't want to make things even more complicated than I already have.

1571169093.0,1571169098.438299,f3uyex7,"This all boils down to hating the individual and the people not getting in line with the rest of the group. I guarantee you that a free market that celebrates individual achievements is the ONLY way we're getting out of this mess. When you have authoritarians who demand control over your behavior, they do nothing but regress a society when you give them power.  


Remember these lessons: If there's a position or institution that can be abused, it WILL be abused. If you create an institution with a benevolent leader, I guarantee you that a power hungry asshole will take over at some point.   


In a free market, when someone is an ineffective leader and cannot produce the results demanded, they go out of business. That's a very, very effective way to deal with these issues. For example: Let's say a fast food restaurant decides to start getting cheap, cracking down hardcore on waste and employee hours. Next thing you know, not enough is prepared and there aren't enough people to supply the labor to compensate for lower preparation. What happens? Those customers are getting irate. And if that's not enough, the employees start to get irate as well and snap back at the customers thinking, ""You have no IDEA what's going on back here!"" The despair of impossible expectations and constant failure to provide a smooth service start to wear on the employees.  


Many people quit and there are those who either cannot afford to quit or feel some kind of loyalty to their co-workers and don't abandon them. Whatever the reasons, things continue to go on a downward spiral.   


Now let's say the government steps in like they have in other industries and prohibits new businesses from opening up in the area. People continue having to go to this one place with corrupt leadership because the government refuses to give them a choice. How would you feel about going to a fast food place where your food ends up taking as long to get as preparing it yourself, prices are sky-high, and the employees treat you like shit?  


Luckily, you can choose to not go there. You can prepare your own food at home and move on. But... what if you weren't allowed to bring your own food to work as a secret arrangement between the fast food place and your work? As people decide they no longer want to eat there, suddenly the corrupt entity is protecting itself through illicit means and they would have never had that power without the government protecting them from competition.  


Now, use your critical thinking skills for a moment and extrapolate that scenario to other areas of our economy. It fucking happens. The power industry and healthcare are two very obvious fields where this happens and in particular the insurance industry. Think insulin would be as expensive as it is without government intervention? LOL That's just laughable.  


Now, think about other areas where this abuse of power might be happening. I'm not an anti-vaxxer, so don't get the wrong impression. This is a what-if. Vaccines work. This is scientifically proven.  


But... what if there WAS something wrong with the way we delivered vaccines? What if there was something we overlooked? Or purposefully ignored because the pharmaceutical industry didn't want the necessary incoming lawsuits that would follow? Where changing your procedures would be an admission of guilt. The CDC is operated by people with a conflict of interest. This fact is ignored. If there's an abuse of power happening, it almost certainly is. Whether vaccines cause autism or not is irrelevant. We should always be skeptical and open to questioning the people who are in power because what in the actual fuck do we expect when someone doesn't think they'll ever be held accountable or their good intentions questioned?  


Now, onto the topic of climate change. The science has not been settled. No model we have has been able to make any predictions. Researchers have backtracked and formed models around what's happened in the past and how things might have been different... in the past.. That's not science. That's bull shit. The research that allows for my computer to run - that's science. It took observable experimentation to come up with that. Now I'm not saying that climate change isn't real - it's real enough, but I haven't seen any researcher provide evidence for an imminent disaster, just political talking heads and people with questionable motives who provide no actual publication to support their ideas.  


We have dramatically improved our impact on the environment over the years. Nuclear power has reached new heights when it comes to safety and its impact on the environment, but we ignore that in favor of political points. We point to Chernobyl as an example, or the most recent disaster in Japan. We now have researchers who have come up with positive ways to use nuclear waste as advanced batteries and that's also ignored. Where does the insanity end? We have free market solutions that aren't being implemented for political reasons and we fall for this bull shit hook, line, and sinker.",0.4956737,EMPTY,urokima,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

The wealthy certainly get a substantial boost from socialism from Republican government with 0 taxes paid from corporations, tax kickbacks they never deserved after paying 0 in taxes, underfunding education is certainly doing a great job of creating a nation of idiots (like yourself) who don't know how damaging things are going to be when the US is trying to compete economically on the world stage and instead of competing will be laughed at and ridiculed, much as is happening now. 
The country is deeply in debt because of practices such as I've outlined, as well as subsidizing a defense industry that does nothing but lobbying on how important it is to kill as many non white, impoverished people as possible rather than looking at ways to help nations, not fund and support dictatorships. Look at the military, they have said over and over and over again they don't need new weapons, they need the maintenance, unfunded that leaves US naval ships in disrepair, crews overworked, B-52's still flying decades after they should have been retired. Every now and then there's a news story about someone's grandson flying the B-52 grandpa used to fly. . . What kind of idiocy is that? 

Meanwhile, people like you cry about non-existent 'socialism' as if it's a thing. . . You and your ideology has led to the situation in Syria and betraying our allies the Kurds not once, not twice but three times now and driving them into the arms of the Russian's and Syria's Assad. Great job! You should be proud! I want you to puff out your chest in pride again when the US troops that are there now may lose their lives in greater numbers, possibly lose nuclear weapons to that idiot in Turkey (who you probably worship, just like any other dictator).
The amount of funding the national parks and other areas need is a drop in the bucket compared to the undeserved farm subsidy dollars the billionares grift the taxpayer for on imaginary farms they really don't have or if they do have them they certainly don't need Republican socialism. . . 
In conclusion, you need to crack some books my friend. Start with US history, the constitution, the bill of rights, world history, civics, and quite a few areas you wander in the dark about. 
You know nothing about 'socialism' or really, and clearly, not much of anything else. I hope you have a miserable life after the orange stooge and his buddies get what's coming to them. All of you deserve to wander through life in a legacy of ashes. . . 

By the way 'government' has worked and worked well for thousands of years.

Correct me if I am wrong but you are saying that the difference between socialism and capitalism is just who gets paid.  Either the workers or the owner.  I've usually seen capitalism defined by commodity production, that is goods are produced solely for exchange, and production is dictated by the bourgeoisie class.  This tends to be paired with defining socialism as a mode of production in which the sole criterion for production is use-value.

Under these definitions your description of socialism would still fall under capitalism, being that goods are still produced as commodities for consumption.  Am I wrong to say that?

The reason why socialism is called socialism is because of the social aspect; i.e. the group of people undertaking commodity production decide what to do with the gains resulting from their produce, or how to make it, or even what to make in the first place. Capitalism on the other hand elects to place all that power in the hands of the owner of the Capital.  

Its interesting to me to note your assumption that socialism and capitalism might have different use-values to motivate production. I don't see any reason for those reasons to be different. A socialist and a capitalist would get the same use-value out of virtually every product, so I find it hard to see why they would have different motivations for production.  

But yes, the definition of socialism I am working on would still include, to use Marx's term, the valorization of capital, it's just when that process is done, instead of letting the Capitalist do whatever he wants with the rewards, the workers that produced that surplus value do so instead. This is a very minor change, and to some people Socialism has evolved to mean this instead.

Do you even know what that word *means*? Or do you just think it sounds scientific? Reality check; talking about ""specific aggregates"" doesn't make any sense since an 'aggregate' is literally the *combination* of specific elements.

I will *again* point out that **you** responded to someone arguing about carbon by calling them a liar and. You don't get to just shift the goalposts again.

> This is basically what you're doing, you're taking CO2 pollution and claiming that's basically the whole pollution story. Yet that's so far from the truth that it's sad to even continue this conversation.

Except CO2 pollution is by far the **number one** issue we're facing collectively. You can try and avoid having to admit you were wrong by suddenly shifting tack and creating this bullshit narrative about different types of pollution; but even IF you could somehow support your claim that when looking at those other types of pollution that poor people pollute more overall (and you fucking can't); it's meaningless **distraction**; because those other types of pollution are mostly contained locally and are not the root cause of the most important environmental crisis we're in.

2. Your point on the antifa thing is null considering your blatant mischaracterization of the parade. 

3. I didn't realize she said the twelve years thing verbatim, but still, in context it was an obvious use of hyperbole trying to generalize a group of people's concerns about an issue that affects them, hence the use of ""we"". When talking so generally, I think it's very much so spinning her words when ""the world is gonna end"" is colloquial speak that could very well just refer to societal collapse or even just an unprecedented hellworld, both of which are plausible. 

4. I don't understand what exactly the twitter blocking thing has to do with anything I said, but big surprise; people are contradictory sometimes and this is the most milquetoast example of a politician being hypocritical. Ignoring that though, she makes completely valid points: the legislation she was suggesting was obviously directed at people like Trump, and every citizen in the United States is one of his constituents. The same cannot be said of AOC, obviously.

In conclusion, all you've done is shown your bias through your-- extremely lacking-- sources, and your unwillingness to engage in good faith with a politician who (refreshingly) does almost exclusively that.

No mention of capitalism. And no mention that all capitalist markets would have to naturally adhere to this tendency. And they mention this is the natural condition of markets where money supply is fixed, or grows less fast than population of economy. So there are certain conditions which markets must have for this to apply.

> Artificial intelligence research organization OpenAI has achieved a new milestone in its quest to build general purpose, self-learning robots. The group’s robotics division says Dactyl, its humanoid robotic hand first developed last year, has learned to solve a Rubik’s cube one-handed. OpenAI sees the feat as a leap forward both for the dexterity of robotic appendages and its own AI software, which allows Dactyl to learn new tasks using virtual simulations before it is presented with a real, physical challenge to overcome.


> In a demonstration video showcasing Dactyl’s new talent, we can see the robotic hand fumble its way toward a complete cube solve with clumsy yet accurate maneuvers. It takes many minutes, but Dactyl is eventually able to solve the puzzle. It’s somewhat unsettling to see in action, if only because the movements look noticeably less fluid than human ones and especially disjointed when compared to the blinding speed and raw dexterity on display when a human speedcuber solves the cube in a matter of seconds.


> But for OpenAI, Dactyl’s achievement brings it one step closer to a much sought-after goal for the broader AI and robotics industries: a robot that can learn to perform a variety of real-world tasks, without having to train for months to years of real-world time and without needing to be specifically programmed.",0.07850995,EMPTY,mvea,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

wealth of nations. To realize that objective, he argued that: (1) there should be specialization and
exchange in markets free of government and other restrictions on free competition among 
capitalists, and (2) each **capitalist should maximize the share of operating profit devoted to the 
growth of capital. **

Gordon and Rosenthal (economist and statistician). 

> Moreover, the development of capitalist production makes it constantly necessary 
to keep increasing the amount of the capital laid out in a given industrial 
undertaking, and competition makes the immanent laws of capitalist production to
be felt by each individual capitalist, as external coercive laws. It compels him to 
keep constantly extending his capital, in order to preserve it, but extend it he 
cannot, except by means of progressive accumulation.

Karl Marx

You deny that the West has responsibility for inspiring other societies to an unsustainable lifestyle, but are instead pushing a narrative that the West had direct responsibility for these bad decisions by denying the poor any other way to get ahead, outside of brutal competition. This is laughable. 

It didn't take the modern economic system to cut down the sprawling forests of Europe and Asia, in a veritable pre-modern habitat destruction that drove many species into extinction or into small shrinking islands of viable habitat - like the Asian Rhinoceros or the Panda. These species used to range across all of India and China, and were limited to refuges free of extensive settlement well before the modern period, due to agriculture. The rapacious nature of industrialization everywhere is not because of coercion on the part of foreign powers, it is because of greed. If anything, the masses are the *least* responsible for the original Industrial Revolution, because the idea of the masses as consumers who could benefit from the system did not exist yet.

The flaw is that you're presenting this as an issue of poverty. This isn't the fault of people in poverty. People in poverty are not causing massive impacts in any capacity - they are scrabbling to survive with limited resources on a subsistence basis, all over the world. It is the general population of consumers which demands more food, for cheaper; which demands cheaper manufactured goods or factory jobs; which sends out massive trawlers that obliterate entire marine ecosystems for the sake of cheap fish. It is the consumers, in Brazil and elsewhere, which have caused the destruction of the Amazon; the industrialization of China has produced a powerful, unapologetic middle class.

The data points are piling up: UK renewables out-generated FFs(fossil fuels/fossil fools) for the whole of the third quarter. On the US grid FFs account for 66% of capacity which is set to fall to 48% in the next 3 years according to the renewables pipeline maintained by FERC, lower if the rate of renewable deployments picks up.

In the storage area: lithium ion battery storage costs fall by about 20% per year.  This is not news. It should not be news that if costs fall at that rate for a decade then the final cost is 10% of the original. But it is news, at least according to BNEF, that prices fell more than 80% over 9 years. The key point is reached when the cost of local solar/wind + lithium ion battery storage reach the fuel cost for FF power plants.  We hit that point over the next 5 years or so.

On the transportation front: globally the light vehicle market is in decline due mostly to economic factors, but within that market ICE vehicle sales are shrinking faster than the market while EV sales are booming. The coming recession will, as usual, drive the legacy automotive industry sales to much lower than their break even point.

> ""We're talking about single-payer health care that has already been successful in many different models, from Finland to Canada to the UK,” she said. 

> Ocasio-Cortez, who is still paying off her student loans, also believes in tuition-free public colleges and universities. Her platform includes guaranteeing Americans a living wage that maintains ""basic levels of dignity so that no person in America is too poor to live,"" Ocasio-Cortez said. ""That's what democratic socialism means in 2018, and not this kind of McCarthyism Red Scare of a past era.”

All you need to do is live in a small town to see that no privacy and no tech involvement in that is perfectly normal. Before the industrial revolution when you're all living in small villages, hardly travelling more than 5 miles from them - the entire population of the world lived with this lack of privacy. It's normal to not have privacy and for everyone around you to know your business. That's how we evolved as modern humans, in that environment. 

You could never move away from your past - as soon as you arrived somewhere new you'd be the outsider, treated with suspicion and excluded. That's normal. You could never walk around anonymously - everyone knew who you were, where you were, where you lived, who you lived with. You could never interact with privacy. This is how it always was, and still is in half the world this very minute. Privacy isn't gone, it NEVER ARRIVED in most of the world, and where it did arrive, it will again depart and we will regress to the mean. 

Your cultural encapsulation and inexperience with half the planet makes this foreign to you, which is sad and pathetic. This isn't a difficult concept. Pull your head out of your ass.  When I arrived in the town where I now live, in a  modern secular democracy, everyone in town knew my name, some level of my employment history, and what i looked like BEFORE I ARRIVED, because that's a small country town - that's how they work.

Global politics is like an ocean with tides. Positive change is usually followed by negative trends and shifts which are then again followed by positive change.
 
Collectively we take 10 steps forward, 2 steps backwards, then 10 steps forward again. Except that this is a general view of things. On the specifics lots of parts of the world take 100 steps backwards and take a very long time before they take any steps forward again.
 
There was never a doubt historically that there would be another Hitler and another CCP. What's different this time is we've taken so long to get to this point. Usually we get here a lot more rapidly.
 
And it's also pretty weird that we haven't gotten to WW3 yet. Given the rate of change globally, we should be going through these cycles faster and faster. Except the opposite is happening. There's some sort of resistance.
 
Hong Kong is a good example. If this were happening in 1919 instead of 2019, there would be 100,000 person human pies by now just like Tienanmen square.

So, on that basis the Wests pollution is far larger than what is shown on paper as we send it all to poor nations, whether thats CO2 producing manufacturing or just literal garbage.  


Its almost impossible for someone with fuck all to pollute as much as the average middle class westerner. as an example is myself. the middle class person can never pollute as little as i can, assuming they went totally green they still could not reduce their pollution enough. i only make 15k a year, i have no transport and my 'net worth' is 3k. my job has been labor, mainly planting trees of which ive done well over 10,000.  


This is why the west pollutes more, in fact 1 middle class american pollutes more than 10 indians, or 2.5 chinese, or over 20 nigerians. if you have money you will spend it on useless crap that no one ever needed, stuff that someone who is poor would never be stupid enough to buy (3 cars, massive house, a computer and a smartphone and a laptop and a tablet on top of 3 separate TVs, bi-yearly holidays, and roughly 20k in random items that most people wouldnt even notice missing due to how little it is used).

Libertarianism is pure fantasy, utterly unworkable. any society that relegates government strictly to the role of enforcing property rights (i mean honestly the idea of 'natural rights' is already stupid) will 100% end up being dominated by either an individual or group. monopoly is the end result of no regulation of the 'free' market. in fact the closest thing the human race has ever had to a true free market is hilariously the black market as it has no government regulation and naturally ends up being controlled by a few powerful cartels who then both fight each other and act in unison depending on how much benefit there is (exactly what happens in any field or industry, any sane business seeks to crush competition and move onto the much safer rent-seeking or simply from up 'not-cartels' where they all raise prices at the same time).  


using your bizarre town example lets say there is a town where the only hospital wont help black people (libertarian society,they dont have to do shit). what happens? well all the black people either leave or they all die, or on the off chance that one is rich enough they could start their own hospital. however this leaves everything to a combination of luck and the benevolence of the wealthy.

The reason why things like factoring numbers are so hard is because there aren't much better ways to factor things than just trying a bunch of prime factors until one works. (lets ignore quadratic sieve, GNFS, etc. for now). For example, a regular computer trying to factor 9991 might try the following steps:

* Remainder of 9991/2 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/3 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/5 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/7 = 2: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/11 = 3: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/13 = 7: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/17 = 12: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/19 = 16: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/23 = 9: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/29 = 15: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/31 = 9: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/37 = 1: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/41 = 28: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/43 = 15: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/47 = 27: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/53 = 27: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/59 = 20: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/61 = 48: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/67 = 8: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/71 = 51: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/73 = 63: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/79 = 37: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/83 = 31: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/89 = 23: not a factor

* Remainder of 9991/97 = 0: 97 is a factor!

Phew, 25 steps, that's a lot! Well not really, but when you have really, really large numbers, this could take longer than the age of the universe!

Quantum computers are different, since the individual units (called qubits) can represent two or more things at once. Rather than just being a 0 or a 1, it could be partially both at the same time. This can get confusing, but just go with it for a second. Using this ability to be more than one number at the same time, the method for factoring numbers can go roughly like this:

* Create a hybrid qubit number representing all of the prime factors of interest: q = <2,3,5,7,11,13,17,19,23,29,31,37,41,43,47,53,59,61,67,71,73,79,83,89,97>

* Compute the remainder of all of these primes, at the same time, in just one step, by dividing 9991 by this hybrid number:
Remainder of 9991/q = <1,1,1,2,3,7,12,16,9,15,9,1,28,15,27,27,20,48,8,51,63,37,31,23,0>

* Check the hybrid result to see if any of them are zero: yup, the last one which corresponds to 97

Only 3 steps instead of 25, much faster! But what's really more important is that this scales to larger factorizations. Fortunately, it does! The number of states the qubits can represent is equal to two raised to the power of the number of qubits. If you only have 2 qubits, that's only 4 different states at once, but if you have 400, you can have over a googol states represented at once! This number of states is roughly equivalent to the number of factors you can include in the hybrid qubit number from step 1. So if the number you want to factor is about 2^2048 (about how large is used today for security in RSA), you'll need enough space to hold all prime factors between 1 and the square root of your number (~2^1024) to be certain you'll find the factor. This is about 2^1014 prime numbers, which means that if your computer has on the order of just 1014 qubits, you could crack today's encryption. By comparison, current computers have access to *billions* of regular bits.

Quantum computers aren't good at everything, but for certain applications like search, integer factorization, and simulating quantum processes, if a quantum computer had even close to the number of qubits as a current computer has bits, it will run so fast its as if the regular computer is literally a potato

[50%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/alaska_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in Alaska, and [49.1%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/oklahoma_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in Oklahoma experience intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking.  
         
In contrast, [29%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/kansas_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in Kansas and [25.3%](https://assets.speakcdn.com/assets/2497/north_dakota_2019.pdf) (pdf) of women in North Dakota  experience intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking.    
                     
Per the NCADC data, a woman in Alaska is about 1.98 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking than a woman in North Dakota.  
        
Per the NCADC data, a woman in Oklahoma is about 1.7 times more likely to be a victim of intimate partner physical violence, intimate partner sexual violence and/or intimate partner stalking than a woman in Kansas.    
         
Numbers like 1.98 and 1.7 might not seem like a big deal, but they are a big deal for the millions of females victimized each year in the United States in all age groups, e.g., age 1 year and older.  
               
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) data in the most recent National Intimate Partner and Sexual Violence Survey ([NISVS](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/datasources/nisvs/summaryreports.html), 2015) shows, [21.3%](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf#page=19) of females in the U.S. were victims of completed or attempted rape one or more times in their lifetimes, and [43.2%](https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/pdf/2015data-brief508.pdf#page=21) of those victims were age 18 or younger the first time they were victims of completed or attempted rape.   
        
The data indicate the percentage of males, the ""subculture"", involved in such disgusting behavior and abuse against female victims likely varies from state to state if one uses the percentage of female victims in each state as a yardstick.",0.262379,EMPTY,Molire,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

First right wing economist? What is that? Second, economists generally don't use one dimension of an actor/situation for a definition for analysis. The entrepreneur does many things. They don't just seek one thing, nor act in one manner. 
      
>Because they don't know what individuals are going to do either, they make their approximations based on that ideal actor, just as I have done here. 
  
Austrian economists make a priori claims, they don't make statements about an ideal type of person or their values.  
    
They would make a statement like- ""human action has purpose"". What this purpose is isn't defined. Just that action requires purpose.

government subsidies transmute potential demand into kinetic demand with subsidies. when this kinetic demand his the market, the restricted supply and increased demand causes price inflations. *the government subsidies therefore increase to meet these inflations, further inflating the price beyond reality.*

this is what has happened with student loans. the government starts giving loans, students take the loans. the people who run universities aren't stupid, and there aren't that many universities being started. so the increased demand and restricted supply causes price increases, which causes the government to increase the size of their loans, which causes further price increases, which causes an increase in the size of subsidies, and so on.

the reason why healthcare costs so much is because of the artificially restricted supply and increased kinetic demand caused by government subsidies.

the smart thing to do would be to train more doctors and create more clinicians who can handle things that don't necessarily require a doctor to do, so that when you see a doctor it's for something serious rather than to get anti-biotics for strep throat or something. this would increase the supply of healthcare. the next thing to do would be to try to unwind the effects of these subsidies. but that's not really possible without a lot of pain (ie, it's politically infeasible), because now the subsidies are built into the prices.",0.26315075,EMPTY,KirkegGerfubbler,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

I start a company. I take out a salary of 80.000$ per year, which i pay income taxes off. Someone values my company to be worth 10 million dollars, based off brand recognition, employees, maybe ownership of patents and future ability or whatever.  


Now, theoretically, i own 10 million dollars, which i have to pay wealth taxes of. Lets say its just 1%. Thats 100.000 dollars.

1571184594.0,1571184602.1583657,f3vtqb5,"Well no it's not. But also yes it is. So all it is is comparing how much each person pollutes while also accounting for how much access they have to certain pollutants. (most people in India do not have access to cars or other industry level lifestyles, etc.) Now let's compare how much they emit per capita to Americans with the same lifestyles. Also compare overall pollution (because that's important as well to climate change and really shouldn't be ignored. Also mind you, the original statement was the top 10% basically do all the polluting, and I was just basically saying that wasn't true. And that isn't true.... I do stand by that.)

Er we don't really send literal garbage overseas. That's mostly a myth. We do send our businesses overseas and as a result those factories no longer emit in the US, so that aspect is true. But I wouldn't find it very convincing if you were going to say the US is the leading cause of their emissions... But, I will accept the argument that if those businesses had stayed in America they'd be polluting fewer emissions due to stricter emission controls in the US than in India/China. So it's a complicated answer for this one.

Actually you'd be surprised. So this is an extreme example, but compare pollution of the past to pollution today. People are far richer in the US today and yet US emissions per capita have decreased significantly since the 70s. This is mostly due to technology making things cleaner, but still. Why would they bother to even invent tech that makes things cleaner? Because they're rich enough to care about it. The poor in the US don't even come close to actual poverty. Only the homeless can compare to true global poverty, in all honesty. So if you have a job, you're officially in the what? 5-10% top earners in the world? And you're part of the richest .001% of humans to ever exist ever.

And do you work full time? If you do then you're working below minimum wage... Anyway I don't really want to speak on things I don't know, but I will say that you specifically might not contribute much to pollution (and that's a good thing) but remember that you also plant trees for a living. You are negatively contributing to pollution and helping the planet. But you also make a significant amount more than the people described earlier. A lot of people in India are lucky to make 2 bucks a day. You look at their cities and, not to be rude but there's literal shit in the streets. I know we all talk about CO2 emissions but as stated before, pollution is pretty broad. They have the technology to build sewage systems but don't. It's a complicated issue but yea I guess my point is you definitely don't come anywhere near that level of pollution. And my other point is... These people are so desperate for economic uplifting that I doubt they're going to care about how many emissions they're creating in the future.

There's a lot to unpack in this, but you can physically see the differences in how clean/dirty things are. You can go to their rivers and see all of them are vastly polluted. You can see the trash just piled up. Look at Haiti or some of these poor countries in South America and Africa. It's a bit eye opening. Do you really think they truly pollute less than your rich neighbor with a recycling box outside his front door? lol I'm not under the impression they do.

tl;dr the richer people get the more they'll care about not polluting. And CO2 being higher for them is simply a product of accessibility to pollutants, not the reverse: the richer people get the less they care about polluting.",0.37368882,EMPTY,atlasunchained,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

When you convince the working and middle 99% to pay a dozen or so percent more in taxes to move people a couple hundred miles into a house they dont pay for and to also pay for their food, possible rehab, and all other living expenses, then the problem will be solved. 

and on barely affording food or rent, rent isnt bad whatsoever if you dont live in a megalopolis, a nice 1 bed apt. goes for maybe $600 near me, it's only expensive when you decide to live in the most populated cities known to mankind.

In fact, starvations are so rare in america that they really aren't recorded due to the rarity of it. the general statistic seems to be about 5000 a year, and even then a majority of those are elderly and children who are neglected. The world health organization said that in 2004 only about 120 people died from starvation. its a bit of an old statistic but i doubt it duplicated a significant amount since then. somewhere around 35% of america is obese, so even if we assume 100% of the 1% is obese, that means a solid 3rd of america eats too much food. in fact, statistics show obesity is more prevalent among those of lower incomes. You're entirely wrong on all accounts.

The only thing i'll concede on is the homeless people, but you're looking at it insanely watered down. many of the homeless people have severe substance abuse problems and need rehab before we can even imagine reintegrating them into society, the issue is, thats fucking expensive, and the majority of the cost would be shouldered by the working class, not to mention the bureaucratic nightmare that would come from somehow moving them from heavily populated areas into areas with low population and room for more people while convincing the people in that area that welcoming in possibly mentally unstable people who are possibly in need of help for mental issues or substance abuse is a good idea. you cant. how many people would be comfortable having a meth addict as a neighbor? even in most cases where the person really wants to recover, people wont care, they dont see him as a complex human being who's lived a life equally as full as theirs, they seem him as a simple label, ""crazed drug addict"". until you rid all of humanity of this label slapping dogma in which they view others as simple beings that consist of their most manifest traits, you wont convince people that it's a good idea. is that shitty? yes. i dont condone letting people die in the fucking streets. 

Oh mind you im talking solely about Unsheltered. let me open pandoras box on you: the majority of homeless people arent living on sidewalks. Some statistics from the US Department of Housing and Urban Development show that out of the 552,830 homeless people in the US in 2018,  358,363 are sheltered. they have a place to sleep at night, they have a place to eat and bathe, they just dont have their own house. These stupid statistical errors everyone makes is because every level of the US Government is completely fucking incompetent when it comes to properly naming things.

The worst thing is the fact that you just ignore the support their is for them.  National Low Income Housing Coalition is one, you've also got Housing First. lets not forget how google pledged a small amount of 1 billion USD to build 20,000 houses for the homeless in the san francisco bay area which has insanely high homeless rates. Public Libraries also tend to do alot given that they're sorta free and all. 

I refuse to concede on americans supposedly starving because thats a lie. the evidence is there. but i will concede a good bit on the homeless, but you've ignored so many things. you act as if the 550k homeless are just groveling on back alleys starving to death and ignored by everyone, they aren't. about 2/3rds of homeless are sheltered, and therefore aren't living on the streets. the amount of support for them is pretty large too, there are many organizations and groups with the sole purpose of helping homeless people. they aren't ignored, they haven't been, there's proof of heavy support dating back to the 80's. not looking for these things doesn't mean they dont exist. They do exist, they have existed, your lack of knowledge on them doesn't make them nonexistant. a falling tree in a forest still makes a sound, even if you cant hear it.",0.56864893,EMPTY,Kairoto,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

1571188550.0,1571188568.1992476,f3vzpdj,"TLDR version: I respectfully disagree the education is the answer. It's more complicated than that, and I think IQ is at the heart of the problem.

>First, birth rates are falling worldwide in all populations, 
Not in Sub-Saharan Africa. If what you said were true, then world population won't pass the landmark of 8 Billion by 2023. The UN seems to think we will anyway.The 26 countries with the highest fertility rates in the world are all from Africa, ranging from 7.1 to 4.43.

Birth-rates like that are one factor driving mass emigration, and will make it worse as their populations mushroom and their land's carrying capacity is exceeded. If it were simply a problem of education, the vast amounts of charity pouring into Africa would have made at least a dent in the poverty rates and violence, but even after decades, it's like throwing money into a hole; It all goes into the pockets of selfish and corrupt kleptocrats and thieves. Even the attempt at education in Africa keeps failing, because many of the indigenous teachers are lazy, useless, corrupt and exploitative of their students. They don't don't bother to show up for classes, they show up drunk, they hold their student's education hostage for bribes and sexual favors. These are the TEACHERS, mind you. That speaks to me of a culture that may not even be educable at all. 

They still believe in witchcraft and wizards. They still believe that a great leader can cure AIDS with an herbal concoction rubbed on a person's chest. They believe that the severed limb of an Albino person can confer great wealth and success.

Meanwhile, in North-East Asia, where the average IQ is above 105, education has a near holy status, and no one questions its value. No one exploits it for personal gain, and the entire society and culture do their utmost to make sure that their children have the best educations they can personally achieve.

What that says to me is, intelligence gains one a better education, and the mean intelligence of your populace reflects their priorities in that regard. Smart people care more about learning, and go to greater lengths to acquire it.

I came to the belief that IQ made such a pivotal difference in human success and failure because of Africa, and the fact that the populations there have such abysmally low IQ test results. That can't be coincidental. There is something really going on. At the same time, the nations with the highest IQ results are all extremely wealthy and productive, and many of them have been since the industrial revolution. 

Another aspect of intelligence that will hamper education and possibilities for population control - IQ is like height. What you are born with is what you will have, full stop. It develops as you age, yes, just as you get taller as you reach adulthood, but you can't go any further from there. It is a quality that can't be raised by any means known to science. If it changes during your life, it isn't because of you getting smarter, but most likely because of privation being mitigated by proper nutrition. 

[This](https://viewoniq.org/wp-content/uploads/2019/03/WORLD-IQ-MAP-QNWSASGEO.png) is a map of average IQs for each nation across the world. Note where the highest IQs and lowest IQs occur. Note that they seem to correspond to relative prosperity, as well. [This](http://worldpopulationreview.com/countries/total-fertility-rate/) is a map of world-wide fertility rates.

There are plenty of trade schools that teach in-demand jobs.  People have gotten lazy, they don't want to move away to get a good job.  I have lived in 4 different states.  They are begging for oil rig workers up north.  Electrical linemen for the local electric company get paid quite well.  And during storm season they get massive overtime.  But if it is your dream job is to say ""ya want fries with that?"" then you need a new dream.  No one else is building facilities for production or services but those that know how to make money.

This bad self serving company BakeryTM while exploiting the economic status of country X, Y and Z has ended up increasing that countries cost of living and quality of life substantially, thereby increasing the global average standard of living.

BakeryTM could be replaced by any international corporation. I am not advocating this methodology to equalize the worlds standard of living, I just recognize that it is a truth inherent to exploitation, that eventually there is no one left to exploit.

https://www.greencarreports.com/news/1093785_where-are-natural-gas-vehicles-most-popular-and-most-numerous

But to your point about solar and wind, sure they don't require ""fuel"", but they do require sunlight and wind which are far more variable than any fuel supply, including being nonexistent at night. Even in California and Germany with the world's most dedicated renewables mandates, it is almost entirely natural gas and coal, respectively, that keep their grids powered overnight.

Also, energy supply most always exactly match energy demand or the grid will fail. Operators can't control demand so they must control generation to achieve this. However they cannot control the weather, so wind and solar become another *source* of variation rather than a tool to help solve it, requiring even more *dispatchable* (operator-controlled) energy sources. Right now natural gas peakers are preferred in the US (about 1/10th the cost of batteries but still far more expensive than baseload sources such as combined cycle natural gas or nuclear, but extra peakers are needed for their ability to adjust output faster so that the variance from wind and solar won't destroy the grid, and this is one of many costs **not** factored into LCOE)

https://thehill.com/blogs/pundits-blog/energy-environment/291963-why-renewables-alone-cannot-meet-our-energy-needs

Even if this wasn't the case, every other energy source that **doesn't** depend on the weather would still be a far better hedge against natural gas availability.

But what is does mean is that (since it isn't flexible) the blimp wouldn't be able to lift more than 3 times the weight it could at sea level (not checking the buoyancy equation, this seems intuitive and I'm tired), and it's not just a third of maximum carrying capacity since the empty ship counts too. So it could not lift much at that altitude. *(Also mentioning that airliner fly at that altitude is useless because it's a totally different principal that makes them fly that high, it's based on lift which is generated with speed for them, not based on buoyancy. Planes are only really limited at how high and how hot their engines can perform while giving them enough thrust)*

Blimps at the time of the German zeppelins used hydrogen too. So it was easier to go higher and it also must have been lighter than the current one which is planned to be in aluminum.

Even if they still managed to pull it off, when it was hydrogen and you needed to lower altitude, you would just vent that cheap hydrogen out. Now with helium, they would need to store it while making air enter so there might be some loss there and helium is much more expensive than hydrogen.

What should and should not be done in private, or how much privacy you enjoy is a cultural thing, but there has always been a level of privacy from official government oversight that has been steadily eroded. The moment we started to keep official records and license various activities there has been a loss of privacy. When Og the Caveman had kids no-one recorded a thing. When Jack Soap decided to emigrate to the new world no-one knew if the name he gave at Ellis Island was his real name or not. And once he disappeared into the American interior he could have changed it again with no-one the wiser. But as we have become more and more recorded, and require more and more paperwork to do anything including merely exist the less privacy and freedom we have had. 

Some of the greatest literature we have has been created because of the ability we used to have to be anyone we wanted, even to pretend to be someone else without much fear of discovery (until of course the climactic moment of discovery!) 

With greater government oversight we have lost a great many freedoms including the right to privacy in our speech, in our expression of self, in our homes, and absolutely in the streets. There will be no more freedom to object to the tyranny of wrong.

Let's test the first idea, say you increase the number of solar farms on a grid five-fold and double their efficiency. They still produce zero power at night, so what is ten times zero? It's been a while since I learned this in grade school, maybe you didn't get that far yet, but I'm fairly certain the answer is still ""zero"".

Maybe ""greater geographic diversity"" could help. Where exactly does the sunlight go at night? Oh right, the other side of the world, about 12,500 miles away at midnight. Gee, I can't imagine any challenges in building a grid that long.

But maybe you don't actually understand why this is absurd so I'll explain. First, electricity generation must always match demand *perfectly* or the grid will fail. Even a state-wide grid is complicated to manage, let alone world-wide.

Second, you'd need to achieve lasting world peace and supreme diplomacy to establish a continuous power connection through friendly countries all the way to the other side of the world without it becoming a political weapon. Then you'd have to figure out how maintain said grid. Also the America's would need to build it underwater, that shouldn't cost much right?

Yet even if you accomplished these miracles and somehow coordinated generation with the other side of the world well enough to not destroy the grid as soon as goes online, by the time the energy travels through 12,000 miles of power lines, almost all of it will be lost to resistance anyway. Using rainbows and unicorns to power the grid would be less of a miracle. I can't believe I have to explain such intuitive, fundamental concepts.

So power at night is either coming from batteries, nuclear, or fossil fuels. Researchers at MIT have done the math for the first option, and MIT is usually considered to be pretty good at this ""engineering"" thing

https://www.technologyreview.com/s/611683/the-25-trillion-reason-we-cant-rely-on-batteries-to-clean-up-the-grid/

>Building the level of renewable generation and storage necessary to reach the state's [California] goals would drive up costs exponentially, from $49 per megawatt-hour of generation at 50 percent to $1,612 at 100 percent.

>And that's assuming lithium-ion batteries will cost roughly a third what they do now.

As for build time, I can't believe I need to explain that comprehensive statistics are always more useful than cherry-picked examples.

https://www.statista.com/statistics/712841/median-construction-time-for-reactors-since-1981/

>The median construction time between for nuclear reactors between 2011 and 2015 was about 66 months.

66 months is five and a half years, in case you were wondering.

 But surely California can build solar faster than that, right?

https://www.energy.ca.gov/almanac/renewables_data/solar/

California generated about 27,000 GWh of solar power in 2018 (including solar PV + thermal solar)

https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Palo_Verde_Nuclear_Generating_Station#Description

In 2017, Palo Verde produced 32,330 GWh of clean, consistent nuclear power.

You read that right. As of 2018, just **one** nuclear plant produced more power than **all** of the solar power in California. If the most solar-friendly state in the nation cannot build clean energy from solar faster than an *average* nuclear plant, then who can?

I look forward to hearing your grid expertise explain how MIT's analysis, Wikipedia's empirical facts, California's own government statistics, and the basic common sense that *solar panels need sunlight to produce electricity* are all incorrect.",0.23085421,EMPTY,AlbertVonMagnus,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

With the exception of ""the temperature is getting cooler"" all of this is correct... and maybe 0.1% of people could have composed those sentences... I'm not sure how you can be this knowledgeable yet also apparently so ignorant. The average temperature is not getting cooler, and we know this with numerous direct and indirect measurements. We use a network of satellites to directly monitor incoming and outgoing infrared radiation... the expected result of increased atmospheric greenhouse gasses is reduced outgoing long-wave radiation and that is exactly what we have observed over time. Incoming short-wave radiation is relatively stable by comparison... all that heat is going somewhere, and it's not to power the growth of life... it's going into the oceans, which are rising due to thermal expansion, which we also measure. Another thing we measure is acidity of the oceans, which is also increasing due to absorption of atmospheric carbon, which is causing coral bleaching around the world.

The simple fact is that we have nothing else that is as energy-dense as fossil fuels. No amount of wind turbines or solar power is going to let a boat or aircraft transport hundreds of thousands of tons of cargo across thousands of miles any time soon.

I'm all for every effort at making Shell and their ilk superfluous. I just don't disagree with their argument for why their continued operations can be justified.

Successful change will depend on making fossil fuel companies useless relics. Not by trying to undermine them while simultaneously needing them.

Shell's projections for the world's hunger for fossil fuels in the coming decades is correct. What Shell also readily admits is that their biggest danger isn't misjudging the rate of consumption. It's misjudging the speed at which changes to that rate of consumption can occur.

>""The study findings may seem counter-intuitive, given that (the) sea level has been rising in the region over the past half century, but the dominant mode of change over that time on Tuvalu has been expansion, not erosion.""

>**It found factors such as wave patterns and sediment dumped by storms could offset the erosion caused by rising water levels.**

The paper you linked is littered with these examples of land reclamation, storms eroding or adding soil. In essence, you just proved we barely understand how these islands work. The paper also highlights the pollution and degradation of the coral reefs, so kudos on that.

Also, you claim none of them have degraded, despite the paper pointing out at least 1 tiny tiny island of 0.08 hectares disappearing. So how can you explain why these islands get bigger? If climate doesn't play a role either way, how could some islands grow? 

>In highly modified atoll environments, for example, Palmyra, Majuro, South Tarawa, and some Tuamotu atolls, widespread human‐induced degradation of the reef ecosystem was reported, **including the alteration of the natural sediment supply by water pollution, and the physical destruction of sand banks, reef flats and shallow lagoon habitats by blasting, dredging and land reclamation**

>Additionally, recent studies emphasized that human activities also caused substantial island and shoreline changes in the settled and also in some unsettled but exploited islands of rural atolls

>Furthermore, recent modeling studies highlighted that future increased wave activity under sea‐level rise may increase the frequency and extent of marine inundation on these islands in the event that coral reefs would not keep up with sea‐level rise. This would cause increased soil and freshwater lens salinization, which would in turn affect water and food supply, thereby posing a threat to island habitability

>Using available quantitative data for 146 islands, they showed that despite the high rate of sea‐level rise observed in this area of the Pacific (up to 5.1 mm/yr in Tuvalu over the 1950–2009 period), **all of the sample islands had persisted, with, respectively, 72.6%, 19.2%, and 8.2% of islands exhibiting areal stability, expansion, and contraction.** They concluded that climate‐ocean variability, sediment production, and human activities were the major controls on island change, and stressed that the maintenance of an adequate sediment supply, of unobstructed sediment transport pathways and of sufficient accommodation space at the coast were the conditions required for island persistence over the 21st century. **In line with these findings, they emphasized the major importance of considering in‐country resettlement (vs. external migration) as a major adaptation strategy for atoll countries and territories.**

As for a major climate impact?

>[Although the hole](https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2016/06/ozone-layer-mend-thanks-chemical-ban) will not close completely until midcentury at the earliest, the healing is reassuring to scientists who pushed for the Montreal Protocol. The 1987 international agreement phased out the industrial production of chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs): chlorine-containing chemicals that help trigger the destruction of stratospheric ozone, which screens out cancer-causing ultraviolet light. “You want to be sure that the actions we’ve taken have had the intended effect,” says Solomon, who led the study published online by Science this week.

Or will you argue banning CFCs were pointless?

There's also polar bears invading towns and such, faaar more south than they have ever been because of their habitats melting. There's been a massive drop in bird and insect populations. Any concerns there? Numerous coral reefs are dying off, only off put by scientists and environmental groups trying to create artifical reefs. There's plenty of inuits and other indiginious people who suffer from these changes. There's examples of rabbits and other species with winter coats who get wiped out because they can't shed their white winter coats fast enough. There's the noticeable increase in stronger hurricanes and cyclones around the world, as well as tornadoes. There's been struggles in agricultural communities because of changing rainfall patterns, but thank fuck for GMOs and adaptable farmers. There's the redwoods under threat because of a beetle that migrated down that should not have been able to survive in that climate normally. Greenland glaciers. There's all the mixroplastics and such in the oceans and drinking waters, and fair, they're not climate related, only pollution so who gives a shit, BUT there's fears of ocean currents shifting, which I can't even begin to explain the horrors of, not to mention overfishing and rising temperatures and acidity levels, of which there are many many many examples of when it comes to lakes and rivers. 

There's a reason it's called a ""runaway"" effect. By the time we're able to do something it's too late. There's far too many factors for any single person to consider, and even if dozens work together they will get contradictory data purely because of how hard it is to predict many of these issues.

We fully understand the affect of carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gasses on incoming and outgoing thermal radiation, and we understand that that is the only method by which heat enters or leaves Earth's thermodynamic system. We measure these things directly, with networks of satellites among other things. Each of our many direct and indirect measurements coincide with our expectations given our understanding of physics and the fact that we have added back into the atmosphere in 100 years an amount of carbon that took over 1 million times that long to be removed from it... which is just another way to say that global warming is both the expected and observed result of our activities given everything that we know about the natural sciences.",0.14636609,EMPTY,ChaChaChaChassy,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Hydrogen fuel cells work great in theory and work out terribly in practical applications. It uses platinum (30.000,- dollars per kg) as a catalyst. Hydrogen is terribly inefficient to store and use. Hydrogen fuel cells have a very short lifespan and are very difficult to regenerate. Hydrogen is very inefficient to produce and store, the infrastructure to do so in large quantities would be hideously expensive. And as a fuel, hydrogen is volatile enough that a car can barely store enough for a 100km range if sufficient safety measures are taken.

It's one of those ideas that are great in theory but require decades worth of research and alternative components and processes before it's really viable.

I think you're right, in a way.
We'll probably always want to understand certain judgments or diagnoses of AI in the future and therefore we'll develop theories. But the key point here is that we'll only develop those theories, about why the AI could be right, with hindsight. Perhaps, therefore, I should rather have asked the question as to whether the order of perception, theory formation, examination will be shifting in the future, to perception, examination, theory, although of course one would no longer  speak of examination, but maybe of investigation.

But, well, if we take the objections of the other commentators seriously, and stay with your cancer example: I wonder if the investigation of the AI, on the basis of which it determines the disease, does not have to precede a kind of theory. Maybe this can only be answered on a case-by-case basis, but maybe not. In this context, theory could also mean assuming that we have to examine the body in a certain way in order to find out what's wrong, so: is the selection of the data to be interpreted already based on a theory?

 Another possibility would be to define the judgments of AI as a kind of perception of reality. Also in this case the order would be preserved.",0.060516186,EMPTY,Spargelfarn,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Cargo ships can quite easily and realistically go over to using wind energy, No need for energy density when you can harvest energy as you use it. 

The biggest reason oil and gas are needed is the fact that these changes aren't over night, and that it might still be economical to use oil and gas alternatives. Plus oil is still going to be used afterwards for all the other various products its used  in the petrochemical industry.

The eventual size of the electrolysis equipment is expected to be 60-80 MW to supply heavy vehicles on Swiss roads.

·      In Canada, Hydrogenics, one of the world leaders in PEM electrolysis, the technology likely to dominate in the next few years,[ said](https://globenewswire.com/news-release/2019/02/25/1741414/0/en/Hydrogenics-to-Deliver-World-s-Largest-Hydrogen-Electrolysis-Plant.html) it had sold the world’s largest ever electrolyser system to Air Liquide. This 20 MW unit is approximately eight times the size of the largest existing Hydrogenics installation and twice the size of the previous largest contract in the world.",0.11681045,EMPTY,solar-cabin,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

So, I assume you think ALL land is either rising or falling?  That melting glaciers have absolutely nothing to do with it?

>[The reason is a phenomenon](https://www.sciencedaily.com/releases/2018/12/181219133236.htm) called ""post-glacial rebound,"" explains Chris Piecuch, lead author of a study published on Dec. 20, 2018, in the journal Nature. **Essentially, land areas in the Northern Hemisphere that once were covered by mammoth ice sheets during the last Ice Age -- such as Canada and parts of the Northeast U.S. -- were weighed down like a trampoline with a boulder on it.** At the same time, land around the periphery of the ice sheets -- along the U.S. mid-Atlantic coast, for example -- rose up. As the ice sheets melted from their peak at the Last Glacial Maximum 26,500 years ago, the weighed-down areas gradually rebounded, while the peripheral lands started sinking, creating sort of a see-saw effect. Even though the ice sheets had disappeared by 7,000 years ago, the see-sawing of post-glacial rebound continues to this day.

>To explore why sea levels rose faster during the last century in areas such as Norfolk Naval Station in Virginia and the Outer Banks in North Carolina, Piecuch and colleagues gathered tidal gauge measurements of sea levels, GPS satellite data that show how much the land has moved up and down over time, and fossils in sediment from salt marshes, which record past coastal sea levels. They combined all of this observational data with complex geophysical models -- something that has not been done before -- to give a more complete view of sea level changes since 1900.

Other political factions mostly realize that you can't ""perfect"" or ""standardize"" humanity, and try to work with that fact. Under these systems you're typically allowed to enjoy a lot of liberties, with incentives to act in a globally conscious manner, and some policies against outright destruction of the environment, at the risk of leaving some room for abuse in the system. Not everyone will be motivated to act in the interest of their fellow man, but people who are doing so are doing it willingly and happily and are likely to encourage further support for these world-conscious policies.

Globalists would prefer to remove those choices and incentives, and basically force you into action, even if you weren't at risk for harming the environment in the first place. This is more likely to generate resentment for those policies than anything else, especially since the trade-off requires immediate and regular personal costs for benefits that you will only see in the long run or might not live to benefit from at all, leading to further disregard for the environment and their fellow man, and the eventual abolition of those policies.

It's like a parent asking a teen to do their chores. You can either try to *force* your rebel into cleaning their room, taking out the trash, and washing the dishes, or you can offer them an allowance as a reward for doing what's expected of them.

Present day economy is majorly reliant on transportation of goods, and since it works that way very few stuff is produced locally and population moved out to regions where nearly nothing can be produced locally.

Just as a very-edge-example look at New York City. I don't even know the current population there, but nothing is produced locally, there is no farmland available and population density is through the roof. Food is either produced locally from ingredients transported there or produced elsewhere and delivered. Almost the whole population there relying on being in constant motion or the very least commuting.

Without industrial scale and reliable transportation, a power shortage potentially could kill like half of the population there. Say that power shortage coming in the middle of winter, heating doesn't work, water pumps don't work sewage will stop working eventually, whatever food can be transported in can't be stored and whatever can be is too high in price for a lot of people to afford. And there you have a society tearing itself apart. A bunch of frustrated people packed in tight quarters they can't leave if fossil fuel is cut off and can't really stay either.

What about the same situation in the middle of summer? AC stops working, no water, no working sewage system, no cooling for the high priced food supplies. NYC becoming a breeding ground for diseases.

These are of course just some extreme examples of the outcomes of some longer than few days worth of energy shortage in NYC with the cutting of fossil fuels.

Green and alternative energy sources are neat and I love them but they don't contribute enough power under the current infrastructure to seamlessly allow transition from fossil fuels throughout a year.

To stick with your analogy, even if I am keenly aware of the lava flow coming behind me, trying to walk away from it without moving my other leg forward after the first step will still result with me landing on my face regardless of the threat from behind. It would just make trying to escape said lava more difficult.

It isn't (just) about perfecting technology, but also scaling it up so you can make the transition from the current system. Another analogy would be the Titanic and the small number of lifeboats.

During the old colonial days, the “standard system” was actually known as the British Imperial System. France actually developed the metric system 20 years after US independence. However, America’s greatest advantage was also the reason why it was hindered from changing to the superior metric system: it’s geographic isolation. Due to America’s isolation, it was able to rapidly industrialize with minimal hinderance. This made it increasingly more difficult to change to the metric system because the cost to change all industrial standards within factories increases as America’s industrial power increases. However during that time, European countries were either constantly at war with each other or internally unstable. With every war/revolution, the industrial infrastructure of a losing country is practically destroyed. The main reason the French established a new standard of measurement was because the French Revolution not only overhauled the government, but the physical collateral damage made it cheap to transition to the metric since there was physically less factories that needed to convert. This process occurred after wars as well. However, with America being unscathed due to its geography, it became increasingly more costly and difficult to change its measurement system. Basically, since America is the only country that still exists that was colonized by Britain and became industrialized BEFORE the creation of the metric system 1790, it was unable to convert its measurement system (Britain was able change systems due to its economy and industrial infrastructure crashed since it was constantly at war. Thus the lack of industrial infrastructure was what made it cheaper to transition).",0.07203041,EMPTY,ZombieBlader,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

[Here is the van Beurden speech](https://www.shell.com/media/speeches-and-articles/2019/embracing-evolution.html), given at a conference whose title is guaranteed to raise Reddit hackles: ""Oil and Money"". However, the conference is changing to the 'Energy Intelligence Forum', of which van Beurden says ""I like the new name"".

He says, amongst other things:

> The Getting to Zero coalition announced at the UN Climate Summit in New York last month is a good example of the type of action needed. It brings together Maersk, Citigroup, Shell and the Danish government in a joint push. The coalition is seeking to find a way to put a commercial ship to sea which does not add greenhouse gas emissions to the stock in the atmosphere by 2030. In other words, a net-zero emissions ship. The coalition will also need to work with other governments, ship builders, port operators and more.

> It is a good start. And we will need another coalition to do the same for the next sector, and the next.

> That is not to say any of this will be easy. But I believe that if this type of sector-by-sector action does not happen, the world will fail to meet the goal of the Paris Agreement.

Does commondreams register this? It does not. Did he say what this regrettable publication alleges? He did not. What he does say is that:

> the world needs oil (and gas for that matter). The world needs oil and gas because it is what the world relies on for so much including, often, its most basic needs of heat and food and shelter.

> And that will not change overnight. This is why Shell will continue to invest in oil and gas, even as we work to help speed progress to a lower-carbon future.

Nobody has ever seen this, but if the standard model is to work, it's needed in the works. 

The axion is a prime dark matter candidate. It has to have a mas of around 10^-11 of the electron to tick all the necessary boxes, so probably far lighter than the neutrinos that we know about. There are many experiemnts aimed to find the axion, but to date nothing conclusive has emerged.

The reason why I say this is because I don't think it is a good long term strategy for an oil company to still be going for new for new fossil fuel energy locations that are ever harder to extract. On the short term it looks nice and they can with some unrealistic assumptions predict future growth. But in reality they will be faces with increasing legislation, negative public pressure, rising production costs and decreasing demand as the world moves to a fossil free economy. We are talking decades here. 

On the long term it would probably better for the shareholders to work towards stopping all operations together as existing oil and gas reserves run out or become unprofitable. This would today have an impact on the kind of investments made in exploration and technology. Likely less money goes there which is money that can be given to the shareholders in the form of dividends. If properly managed you could dismantle the entire company with it being profitable for investors and fair to employees.

Instead of dismantling the company they could also focus their investments towards energy flows not based on fossil fuels and this trying to be profitable over the long term.

If prices decrease or increase for crude oil but rise for petrol due to scale, then further moves towards electric vehicles is certain and welcomed imo.

250 million years ago, massive volcanic activity released a huge amount of CO2 into the atmosphere. Here's how that played out. Somewhere between 

&#x200B;

1000PPM and 8000PPM, the heat and acidification pulled O2 out of large sections of the ocean, killing life there. The O2 free waters created a 

&#x200B;

perfect environment for the oldest form of life on earth, aerobic bacteria. These bacteria released massive amounts of hydrogen sulfide into the 

&#x200B;

water and air. Hydrogen sulfide is so poisonous that it was used as a chemical weapon in WW1. It kills all plant and animal cells. It also pulls 

&#x200B;

O2 out of the air and destroys the ozone layer. This event killed 93% of all life on the planet. This is where we are probably headed, if we 

&#x200B;

don't stop. We're headed for human extinction.

&#x200B;

1000PPM is a long way off from our current 440PPM but the worry is that we could get there suddenly by melting the permafrost. This would release 

&#x200B;

huge amounts of green house gasses into the atmosphere very quickly.

I mean more refined technology of the old methods mean less damage done, more efficiency, less pollution in the extraction process and these are finite resources, so you don't get to sit on your hands when you already have one drilling rig because all you got is estimates in regards of how long those resources will last. If you only start looking for a new source and start to set up the drilling infrastructure AFTER you ran out of juice at one place then there you'll have a gap in production.

The investment for future extraction is integral part of the uninterrupted supply chain.

In addition to that if someone wants to make it onto the energy market with a radically new sustainable alternative, the road is open. Present day mentality and perception of renewables are significantly more positive than a couple decades ago and Elon Musk showed that you can do it even back when Tesla was just an electric sport-toy for the rich and renewables were struggling for acceptance and yet to show that they could be capable.

Fossil fuel extraction investments don't cut off the chances of other investors and doesn't prevent them from financing the development or refining of renewables.

Its a product of having a market economy but also a government large enough to regulate, subsidise, and create laws regarding that economy. There are many examples where in a purely market driven economy a lot of these larger companies would have failed long ago (take banking as a prime example) but because of government subsidies they're propped up and become 'too big too fai'l (or rather there's too much government money in them to let them fail, see: sunken investment fallacy).

The solution has to be to either regulate government and market interaction to the point where it isn't beneficial or profitable to lobby the government (although this leaves it open to loopholes) or reduce government to the point where they don't have the power to warrant lobbying (This has the issue of being a somewhat vague line in the sand, and how little government is too little, etc).

The second proposal is the one that people often cite when you accuse of them of handwaving at ""fake capitalism"" but I agree that capitalism can't face climate change, but nor should it - it would be useless as tackling that, which is why it takes people, non-profits, donations, volunteers, and education of the problem.

I'm looking forward to the falling prices of renewables to the point where even a common bloke like me can afford a system that can take me off the power grid reliably for decades to come, but we aren't there yet.

I know this because my not-young parents just invested into getting a solar system to reduce the electricity costs and it won't be able to completely take over as the source of the electircity. Even like this they had to take out a significant loan that will be paid for a decade or two, and by the time the loan is paid back we'll be at the end of the life cycle of the solar panels that will be heavily outdated by that time.

I'm really interested in how the hazardous materials in the panels and the electronics will be recycled at that time or they'll just go to the landfill like some cheap solar powered products do these days.

People tend to think of solar as a perfectly clean energy source but somehow nobody ever considers the ""carbon footprint"" of the production and recycling at the end of the life cycle so those things are far removed from the consumer and so easy to forget about.",0.06826207,EMPTY,ColemanV,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

In a basic sense, if citizens don't have enough tech literacy, and this threatens the development of society, why can we not pay people to go talk to each other?  Why can we not hire couriers to states' interests and tell the public that they should be hospitable?  That technology is a profoundly ancient one, but not only have real gains been made throughout history by such means, it is still used in a limited form today.  Even in poor communities, the knowledge that we're trying to reach to every corner is often present in a substantial fraction of those populations.  We need pay only the wages of a poor community to have the members of such a community baring information to each other.

If people were peaceful and honest enough, one of the dividends of a universal basic income would be that there would be more people with the funds to do things that benefit their community without leading to much potential of individual profit.  I don't know if people are that peaceful and honest.  I don't know how to *learn* if people are that peaceful and honest.  Still, it's one of the dividends that I long to see achieved.  Imagine if we had more people who could attend every public meeting and scrutinize all public finances.

As for regulation in technology...  Self-regulation in tech has been possible thus far because of the statistically favorable ethics of programmers.  I don't know what force *created* that potential, but I still believe despite all ""hackers"" and such that it is a real influence.  Sometimes even hackers are ""white hats"" trying to defend integrity in society; I still remember a kind of cyberpunk idealism that took ""information wants to be free"" to an extent that...  well, let's just say that I've broken into 1d3 computer systems out in the real world, and I didn't do that malevolently.  I'm both *very* concerned about having a lawful society, and I'm also *not* a programmer.  Sometimes I feel like it would be in a utilitarian sense correct to leave tech unregulated.  Yet sometimes I am horrified by what utilitarianism would point to in technology.  I have a mixed relationship with utilitarianism.  Sometimes I have used it, and sometimes I have been averse to it.  That ideal can be very good or very evil.

In technology, the risk exists that it can sometimes be ""proven"" that it is rational to leave awful situations intact, and technology is one of the strongest arguments that humans can use towards each other.  In today's society as in all past societies, there exist truths the reveal of which could cause ""natural disasters"".  I am speaking euphemistically.  I have a faith that it is correct to puncture the mysteries of society, but I have come grudgingly to recognize that this is a kind of *faith*.  Sometimes also I am aware that the puncturing of mysteries can lead to ""shedding more heat than light"", and sometimes misunderstandings can be so extraordinary that destroying little mysteries can create bigger mysteries.

\---

A more easily grasped risk factor than all of that is... that automation can launder biases.  I think one of the great risk factors is that big tech could be used to ossify society and underutilize human potential.  Sometimes - often, AFAIK! - this is a risk factor that arises not because programmers are *evil*, but actually *despite* the fact that programmers are benevolent.  It is easier to identify what society is, than it is to identify what society could possibly become.  The technologies that make society extremely good at being what it is sometimes do not open the door to a society that would be extremely good at being something better.  Excellent programmers are not always excellent visionaries, and vice versa.

Call me crazy, but facing the odds with the knowledge that we prepared as best as we could counts as the best option for me as opposed to pulling the plug completely unprepared and let fate sort things out.

I'd recommend considering basic human nature. Say that we pull the plug today and chaos follows, war follows, and the former societies degrade rapidly.

Climate may or may not start to move to a desired direction and meanwhile individual people without the comfort of efficient heating and without the systems in place to handle basic needs will return to methods straight out of post-apocaliptic stories, burning wood, burning coal - if they can find any - and burning pretty much anything they can to stay warm in cold nights and cook meals with. Those fires won't be filtered, won't be efficient, waste won't be treated and so on.

That'd put a temporary slow-down effect on the pollution but after the collapse of present day society people would become tribal again and new powers would form around the basic needs, new infrastructures would be built or refurbished on old technology and ain't nobody would be around concerned about climate change when the old systems provide comfort enough for another baby-boom. 

That would mean that humanity is back to square one with an old system that we were supposed to phase out. But that time around, instead of having the concern and technology to actually phase them out the new society would rely on it to provide for a long time while population is climbing again.

Cutting fossil fuels without being prepared for it with alternative resources is a one-time reset switch and if you are mistaken about any of the climate change - either the time frame or our effect on it - all those deaths are on you. (figuratively ""you"")

In fairness, I was just suggesting it as my personal philosophy but rather a proposal that is often argued in favour of Free-Market Capitalism. But I'll argue the point if it helps. 

If you listen to or read the literature of a free market proposition it suggests the *reduction* of government rather than the *abolition* of it. In doing so it would be argued that there is still a necessity for some government, to protect a countries borders and people, to ensure monopolies do not exist, and to ensure regulatory means over dangerous factors to the countries people. There are still laws and there is still law enforcement, so no child labour would be happening either.

The suggestion of a Free Market is exactly that, it's a government that governs for the people, and regulates to that necessity - it isn't a government who subsidises businesses, gives tax breaks to the largest of companies, or regulates the market to such a degree that lobbying can only be done by the rich, and completely shuts out the poor. The whole point of a free market is to allow anyone to compete in it, but when you have a government which is so massively influenced by corporations it is wise to not give them as much power.",0.13942549,EMPTY,ThrowMeAway11117,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

I'm concerned with the validity of IPCC data in that I fear they may have been politically compromised. Examples:

*""Human caused climate change is a theory in which the basic mechanism is well understood, but whose magnitude is highly uncertain. No one questions that surface temperatures have increased overall since 1880, or that humans are adding carbon dioxide to the atmosphere, or that carbon dioxide and other greenhouse gases have a warming effect on the planet. However there is considerable uncertainty and disagreement about the most consequential issues: whether the warming has been dominated by human causes versus natural variability, how much the planet will warm in the 21st century, and whether warming is ‘dangerous’.

[...]

Why do scientists disagree about climate change? The historical data is sparse and inadequate. There is disagreement about the value of different classes of evidence, notably the value of global climate models. There is disagreement about the appropriate logical framework for linking and assessing the evidence. And scientists disagree over assessments of areas of ambiguity and ignorance.

[...]

There is enormous pressure for climate scientists to conform to the so-called consensus. This pressure comes not only from politicians, but from federal funding agencies, universities and professional societies, and scientists themselves who are green activists. Reinforcing this consensus are strong monetary, reputational, and authority interests.

In this politicized environment, advocating for CO2 emissions reductions is becoming the default, expected position for climate scientists. This advocacy extends to the professional societies that publish journals and organize conferences. Policy advocacy, combined with understating the uncertainties, risks destroying science’s reputation for honesty and objectivity – without which scientists become regarded as merely another lobbyist group.*

*""An opinion editorial written by Frederick Seitz ‘Major deception on “global warming” appeared in the Wall Street Journal on 12 June 1996.

This IPCC report, like all others, is held in such high regard largely because it has been peer-reviewed. That is, it has been read, discussed, modified and approved by an international body of experts. These scientists have laid their reputations on the line. But this report is not what it appears to be—it is not the version that was approved by the contributing scientists listed on the title page. In my more than 60 years as a member of the American scientific community, including service as president of both the NAS and the American Physical Society, I have never witnessed a more disturbing corruption of the peer-review process than the events that led to this IPCC report.

When comparing the final draft of Chapter with the version just published, he found that key statements sceptical of any human attribution finding had been changed or deleted. His examples of the deleted passages include:

‘None of the studies cited above has shown clear evidence that we can attribute the observed [climate] changes to the specific cause of increases in greenhouse gases.’
‘No study to date has positively attributed all or part [of the climate change observed to date] to anthropogenic [manmade] causes.’
‘Any claims of positive detection of significant climate change are likely to remain controversial until uncertainties in the total natural variability of the climate system are reduced.’
On 4 July, Nature finally published Santer’s human fingerprint paper. In Science, Richard Kerr quoted Barnett saying that he is not entirely convinced that the greenhouse signal had been detected and that there remain ‘a number of nagging questions’. Later in the year a critique striking at the heart of Santer’s detection claim would be published in reply.""*

>Corbett report

Yeah, I'm really gonna take sound evidence from them, who describe themselves as reporting on ""important issues from 9/11 Truth and false flag terror to the Big Brother police state, eugenics..."". They sound like a really impartial and not at all conspiratorial source. 

Frederick Seitz isn't a climate scientist. He's a well known climate sceptic and was a fucking tobacco industry consultant for god's sake. Y'know, another industry that worked for decades to surpress research that smoking is bad for you. He's not a reliable source, no matter if he did serve as president of the NAS or whatever. He hasn't done the research. 

""In their book [*Merchants of Doubt*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Merchants_of_Doubt), science historians [Naomi Oreskes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Naomi_Oreskes) and [Erik M. Conway](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Erik_M._Conway) state that Seitz and a group of other scientists fought the scientific evidence and spread confusion on many of the most important issues of our time like harmfulness of [tobacco smoke](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tobacco_smoke), [acid rains](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Acid_rain), [CFCs](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Chlorofluorocarbon), [pesticides](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pesticides) and [global warming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Global_warming).""

From his wikipedia page. With the slightest bit of research you can find that he's crooked and not a reliable source.

He also says:

 ""Seitz said that American science had become ""rigid"", and his colleagues had become closed-minded and dogmatic."" 

Many sceptics, some of whom are scientists like Seitz (though next to none are climate scientists) insist on this view. That we're dogmatic and closed minded. That we're intolerant of ideas other than our own. When the truth is, they're the ones flying in the face of consensus, of 60+ years of research. We would listen to them if they could provide a shred of evidence that seriously backs up their scepticism, but there is honestly nothing they've tried that overturns 60 years of research. 

Outlets like the Corbett report are not scientists. They take one data point or argument from a discredited scientist who's been found to be working for an oil company or not even qualified in the proper field (Seitz) and blow it up to make it seem like there's a debate to be had here when there isn't. Something like 97%+ of climate scientists agree with the conclusion of man made global warming, and the general rate at which it's progressing, and that all current goals are too weak to deal with it. There is no debate to be had over this, just as there's no debate to be had over Flat Earth, young earth creationism or vaccinations.

 There is a right side and a wrong side to the climate debate (which makes it not a debate, but hey-ho), and currently you are choosing to listen to the wrong side. Climate science has 60+ years of data, modeling and theory behind it. Sceptics point to some wrong predictions and say ""well if that was wrong, what else must they be lying about?"". 

Ask yourself, what benefit would scientists get for advocating that climate change is a real and extremely serious issue? Who would be paying them? What private interests stand to gain from this narrative being put forward, that we need to change fast in order to save civilization as we know it?

Not a fucking soul. No one financially benefits out of that, certainly not any player big enough that it would make a difference. Now look at the other side. Who stands to gain by sewing controversy into settled science? Who makes money by us *not* doing the right thing and shutting down oil manufacturing and shifting away from fossil fuels? Hint: It's not the scientists.

If the United Fruit Company can get the CIA to overthrow a democratically elected government in Guatemala, then oil companies can definitely make controversy out of nothing and bribe governments to do nothing about climate change because it serves their interests. Scientists have nothing to gain by promoting ""the climate change agenda"" other than hoping that people might actually fucking listen to them and force change. They stand to gain no money, no real reward, unlike companies that stand to gain billions by continuing to produce oil and destroying the planet.",0.43193343,EMPTY,Mrfish31,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

Of course the argument can be made that China has ""closed the gap"".   However, that would be CCP propaganda.  

Anyone who has spent time in China can see the writing on the wall in regards to the Chinese economy.  It's an illusion.  Propped up by draconian monetary and media control by the CCP.  The amount of bad loans sloshing around in the Chinese banking system is staggering.  To the point where entire Chinese banks are being sold on Taobao for a few hundred thousand dollars.  The only problem is, no one wants to buy them.  

Can you imagine an American bank being sold on Ebay for that price and no one buying it?  Bank of America, Chase, Suntrust, Wells Fargo Etc.  

Chinese technology.  That just takes a quick Google search to debunk.  Most of it is the repurposing of existing technology.  Like the Taxi drone.  Or copied technology.  Like the J-31.  Which looks exactly like an F-35.  Which can be said for any plane flying in China.  It's a poor copy, of another plane from America or Russia.

""Sociologist Reiner Grundmann's review in BioSocieties journal, acknowledges that the book is well researched and factually based, but criticizes the book as being written in a black and white manner whereas historians should write a more nuanced description. The book depicts special interests and contrarians misleading the public as being mainly responsible for stopping action on policy. He says this shows a lack of basic understanding of the political process and the mechanisms of knowledge policy, because the authors assume that public policy would follow on from an understanding of the science. While the book provides all the (formal) hallmarks of science, Grundmann sees it less as a scholarly work than a passionate attack and overall as a problematic book.[9]""

So, where do you go from there?

Re the CIA, I mean, you can flip that whole narrative around and claim that this whole new climate change debate is very much part of a psyop. That is why it is important to question and challenge EVERYTHING.

That is also why sources like the Corbett Report are important: every bit of info put out by Corbett is sourced, and you can research those sources yourself and make up your own mind, critically. As such, it's a pity that you discounted Dr. Judith Curry, so it's clear you're not really reading what I've put here. I'll also leave this here:

https://youtu.be/4JJ3yeiNjf4

You also conflate my questioning the narrative with my suggesting (your opinion) that massive corporations should be allowed to rape and pillage the planet unfettered, which is not what I'm suggesting at all. That's a separate issue.

I'm more concerned with the suggestion that these big corporations will not be the very first in line to benefit from green energy... when WE the people are being held accountable for all the wrongs in the world, and WE will be the ones taxed and the ones funding their future profits and OUR children are suffering from anxieties because of the fear and paranoia being spread through the world's public schooling systems!

By influencing policies that affect mpg of vehicles, influencing price by influencing global interventionist policy and corporate subsidies in government, they have slowly curated this feedback loop.

Instead of seeing this as a moment that they can level the playing field and work cleanly they actually spent billions to be able to scrub the air pollution and release it to water instead instead of collecting it.

 [https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/shipping-pollution-sea-open-loop-scrubber-carbon-dioxide-environment-a9123181.html](https://www.independent.co.uk/environment/shipping-pollution-sea-open-loop-scrubber-carbon-dioxide-environment-a9123181.html) 

 

""Global [shipping](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/shipping) companies have spent billions rigging vessels with “cheat devices” that circumvent new environmental legislation by dumping [pollution](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/Pollution) into the sea instead of the air, *The Independent* can reveal.

More than $12bn (£9.7bn) has been spent on the devices, known as open-loop scrubbers, which extract sulphur from the exhaust fumes of ships that run on heavy fuel oil.

This means the vessels meet standards demanded by the International Maritime Organisation (IMO) that kick in on 1 January.

However, the sulphur emitted by the ships is simply re-routed from the exhaust and expelled into the water around the ships, which not only greatly increases the volume of pollutants being pumped into the sea, but also increases [carbon dioxide](https://www.independent.co.uk/topic/CarbonDioxide) emissions.""

So basically it just means that to control the shipping industry the laws need to be tight not only in spirit, but also to letter and there needs to be big enough sanctions on any violations of it. Shipping also (at least used to be) is an industry where risks are separated from returns and individual ships are incorporated in such a way that if any of the risks materialize that particular ship or a small group of ships goes bankrupt and the operators can continue with other ships. These asymmetrical risks used to be carried by the countries/societies or they were left uncarried and the environment just took the damages.

This is all intended to call for a dramatic reduction in the use of fossil fuels, essentially, to put an end to capitalism according to one UN official Christiana Figueres. But there is no credible evidence, much less proof, that GHG causes global warming nor is there any evidence of global warming in the last part of the current interglacial (Holocene) period. It has been dropping on average for the last 2000 years. We humans and mammals face a real danger, however, but not global warming due to anthropogenic forcing. Since we are coming to the end of the current interglacial we can look forward to another ice age (glaciation). During an ice age CO2 levels dramatically fall as does plant growth which is necessary for photosynthesis. If the CO2 levels fall below 150 ppm, it's mass extinction (it has been as low as 182 ppm).

Twenty eight crimes were committed by General Motors and its oil and tire company co-conspirators in the Thirties and Forties leading to their convictions in federal district court in Chicago during the late Forties. The U.S. Justice Department's charge, upheld in court, was that these large companies, inorder to eliminate their major rivals—the trolley industry—bought up these firms, tore up the tracks in and around 28 major cities in the U.S., including the biggest one in Los Angeles, and lobbied legislators to build more and more highways to sell more and more vehicles, gasoline and tires. Earlier, GM tried to pressure banks to reduce credit to these trolley companies and when that did not succeed sufficiently, the conspiracy to buy out their competitors and shut them down was hatched.

With the technology as it stands now, it's looks like wind+solar+storage+transmission investments are already more cost effective than nuclear, and will continue to decrease in cost well beyond nuclear costs. To compound this, nuclear facilities take a long time to build, meaning that their efficacy in immediate decarbonization is worse than wind and solar facilities, which can be up and running in a fraction of the time.

I absolutely, completely and totally disagree. Look up the term ""quitting cold turkey"" because your definition here is **LITERALLY** the opposite of what the term means. 

This feels like 1984 doublespeak, you have quite literally defined ""quitting cold turkey"" to be the opposite of quitting cold turkey, it's pure doublespeak.

>It feels very ignorant and disingenuous to suggest to change the whole world's energy systems, industries and transportation in the span of a couple years is not a could turkey move on a global scale.

A transition is **BY DEFINITION** not cold turkey. Logical consistency and the appropriate use of terms is the opposite of disingenuous, it's rational and logical. 

>It feels like you cherry picking some parts of what I said, because I did mention the possibility of being wrong on the time frame. Having that wrong and pressing tha reset button earlier than necessary can result in countless deaths and that is just one aspect that can be wrong about the estimations.

I disagree that a transition from fossil fuels would cause mass death. Frankly, this feels like a low information conservative conspiracy theory used as a ""false equivalence"" to attack the realities of changing climate.

I completely and totally reject your false narrative that a smart, focused and yes quick transition away from fossil fuel would cause mass death. Unlike my arctic methane case, which is well founded in decades of scientific research, your hypothetical and ill-defined case is pure fantasy without any rational underpinning. 

>Your extended analogy doesn't apply because the onboard engineer got nothing to do with determining the course of a ship nor anyone had a visual on the iceberg before it was too late.

Bullshit, it wasn't too late in the 90s and 00s. When Al Gore made a deal out of it, it was the PERFECT time to begin. We knew in time.

>But to stay with that analogy, the onboard engineer is just saying - before leaving the port - that we'd need more lifeboats or have the existing ones improved so if the Titanic indeed will make contact with the iceberg the chances of survival for the passengers would be the best as they could be. Dismissing the desire for increasing preparedness while rushing actions is simply foolish.

No -- when the ship left port was when we began industrialization. We didn't know 100 years ago the damage that burning trillions of gallons of oil would cause. Science and climatology were not at the point to predict it, and the scale of industrialization was not sufficient to cause it.

This is absolutely a case of learning about the problem while the voyage is underway. This is absolutely a case where we learned about the iceberg in time to slowly and smartly avoid it.

1571237077.0,1571237082.9422588,f3xesmr,"Let's discuss!

First up, these technologies require storage for power during downtime when the sun isnt shining or the wind isnt blowing, something the fuel based technologies dont. 

Batteries: all require rare earths. There are limited amounts of these and they're hard to mine. Hence the term rare. Lithium especially, as recovery rate from recycling is terrible, the ground mining process for it is awful, and the seawater process is energy intensive and low yield. Batteries also start losing efficiency below about 40 F and basically become unusable below zero, again especially lithium based batteries, as if you try and charge them below freezing you will plate the anode instead of proper ion diffusion and ruin the battery. Oh, and Li-Ons have a very finite service life, you only get so many cycles before they literally stop working. Lead acids are heavy and voluminous because of the low energy density, but they're cheap and dont have the service life issues. 

Hydro storage: you can have 2 reservoirs are different heights and pump liquid to the higher one during uptime and let it flow back down through turbines during downtime, using the potential energy as storage. But you need a natural height difference to make it economical in the slightest, and it's a very large land area requirement. Still not super viable.

So batteries are the best storage method, but they have serious hurdles to overcome. Tesla batteries work great in California, not so great in North Dakota when its -20. 

Solar panels are getting better than ever. But they still only function when the sun is shining on them at a useable incidence angle. 90 degrees is of course the best. So the sun shines an average of say 12 hours. Of that, if you have panels at a fixed angle, you only get say 8 hours of light that's useable at all and maybe 4 of light at an angle near maximum efficiency. You can articulate the panels to follow the sun, but that massively increases initial and maintenance costs. Also consider the best solar panels in the world are only approaching about 50% efficiency, and that affordable and durable panels are more around 20%. Also, panels have to be clean to work. So they have to be periodically cleaned and remain uncovered to work. So snow, ice, and hail all pose serious problems without easy or cheap solutions. So does dust or tree debris. Or plain old bird poop. Solar is actually very maintenance intensive.

Wind: first off, turbines are damn expensive. To be economical, they have to be made of composite and that's still very expensive. And composites dont like to be frozen. And they require massive, expensive bearings. And they kill a huge amount of birds. And on and on. 

You are ignoring these problems. They exist, but you just dont want to look at them. I am paying attention, as an engineer they are of great interest to me, but the more I learn the more limitations I see with no good solution. Every single one of the clean energy sources comes with massive compromise (except for nuclear).

used to end WW2 and save, yes save millions of Japanese lives.  The intention was to save 1-2 million American soldiers lives, but they almost certainly saved far more Japanese civilians.   I get a little tired of the propaganda of Nagasaki and Hiroshima being some kind of emotional decision.  It wasn’t.  It was an entirely pragmatic decision to give up the secrecy of the success of the manhattan project, (or any hope of secrecy), to simply save lives, time and materials.  If a United States soldier is wounded next year, he will receive a purple heart medal.  That medal was ordered for the invasion of Japan that never happened.  Every wounded soldier since WW2 has been given a medal that was expected to be used for the invasion and they are no where near close to running out.  After the war, the US was the only country with atomic weapons and still didn’t use them.  For a long time after they had a strategic advantage, and again chose not to use them.

Let's start with that you completely ignored the part when I explained to you that in terms of global changes of energy production and transportation within just a couple years is EQUIVALENT TO cold turkey. You know as in scale of Earth's complete history, humanity's presence is a fart in the wind so a couple of years is like a blink of the eye. You can argue the dictionary definition all you want, but I can argue that ""instant"" change is the matter of perspective. If someone would perceive time 100 times faster than us an ""instant"" of one second would feel pretty long time for that dude.

Instant change is a transition too, it just depends on the observer and scale what ""instant"" is.

And then you ran with my analogy, made it into one that doesn't quite apply, I changed it back and expanded on it so it would fit what I try to convey here and then now you take that analogy and start to spew real life things on it.

Its like you couldn't differentiate between reality and an analogy. IN the analogy I'm saying that the onboard engineer of the Titanic having no influence on where the ship goes simply because he isn't the captain, not even the helmsman.

I was at no point bringing anything political to the argument, you doing that.

From, as I have shown, terrible, disreputable sources.

> in fact, he encourages ***YOU*** to do the fact checking and decide for yourself 

 He may say ""do your own research"", but the sources he provides are incredibly biased and he wants you to use them to craft a world view similar to his, which he knows most people won't do and they'll just say ""well he sources all his work!"". He knows most people will just take him at his word, especially if he says ""hey, the info's out there, I'm just bringing it to you. Go look at the sources I cited. I'm totally using reliable sources and not leaving anything out *wink*"". If you think he's reporting in good faith, I think he's playing you for a fool. Either he knowingly and willingly gets his sources from someone like Seitz, and is therefore duplicitous and not to be trusted as a reporter, or he is ignorant enough to not know better and didn't do proper research on Seitz or the topic at hand, and as such isn't a good reporter. 

As you can see, either way I'm really fine to ignore Corbett, because he's either knowingly drumming up controversy or he's woefully misinformed to the point that his opinion and reporting on the matter is worthless. You will not learn to think critically from a source like him unless you *actually* do the research yourself, and generally come to the conclusion that most of what he says is completely wrong. He's a 9/11 truther for gods sake and had white nationalist Stefan Molyneux on his show. He's like Alex Jones-lite, his opinion on any scientific topic is next to worthless, especially when he's pedaling shit like Seitz. He told you to go and research it yourself, so why didn't you? You took him at his word that he had a trustworthy source, and he clearly lied because I found that the guy he cited was a fraud.

> Re the CIA, I mean, you can flip that whole narrative around and claim that this whole new climate change debate is very much part of a psyop. That is why it is important to question and challenge EVERYTHING. 

My point here was that there is plenty of evidence to show that climate scepticism and government apathy is bought by the corporations who benefit from it, just as UFC benefited from bribing the CIA. You can't flip it around, because there's no special interest who benefits from arguing we should do something about climate change, while there demonstrably are numerous special interests who benefit from there being a debate around a subject that there shouldn't be a debate around due to the science being settled. 

Science is questioned literally every day by the scientists doing it. Every test they do with regards to climate change adds to the conclusion that humans are causing the vast majority of warming. I had a seminar yesterday about the Permian Mass extinction, and the lecturer, in his 60s or so, mentioned off hand that in his life time, the amount of CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third (310ppm to 410ppm from his birth to literally last week). No other phenomenon on earth can possibly account for the increase other than human activity, no climate sceptic has ever been able to provide proof for like, mass volcanism or something that would be needed. If you're getting news from people like Corbett who are trying to teach you to think critically or whatever, to go against the grain no matter what, congratulations. He's played you like a fool. In science, the grain is almost always right, and the people going against it should, unless they have very good evidence for what they say, should be laughed out of town.

This really boils down to a deeper problem that I have with Corbett and others like him. Corbett isn't really trying to make you think critically. He's trying, and apparently succeeding, to make you paranoid of things that have a deep scientific backing in order to make you then more easy to manipulate to other ideas, and disguising it as ""we over here use logic and reason"". The climate scientists were lying? Step it up a notch. Black people caused their own problems and institutionalised racism doesn't exist? Keep going. 9/11 was the government? a little bit more...  Jews run the banks and need killing? Ah. There you are. From sceptic to fascist in a few simple steps. Here lies the pipeline of the Alt-Right and associated movements. You start by finding something that presents dubious evidence for climate scepticism, and you move on to harder and more racist things. Corbett probably isn't a fascist, but he sure as hell is a gateway to people like Molyneux who are, and does them favours by getting them on his show.

And I know this because I almost got sucked in. Five years ago or so I was watching all this shit, Sargon of Akkad, looking at tumblrinaction, gamergate, etc, and was probably not too far from falling into that kind of pit of what I just mentioned. I can't remember what pulled me out, but looking back it's clear that it was a pretty dangerous edge. And I don't want it to happen to you. You can see numerous examples of people this did happen to all over reddit. They try to act like they're thinking so critically, but then they cite their main sources as Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder or something, people who have no right to have any influence over the climate debate, and do the exact same thing Corbett is doing here with climate change and a number of different topics. 

If you want to think critically, then be especially critical of the news sources telling you to think critically, because as I said, normally they just want you to become paranoid about some global ""leftist"" conspiracy that doesn't exist. Thinking critically does not mean ""question literally everything, even stuff I know nothing about"". It's recognising and working out if whoever is presenting it to you has an agenda. The scientists researching climate change have no agenda other than trying to save the planet. They've presented 60 years of data which supports their conclusion. People like Seitz, and Corbett who cites him, have an agenda. Seitz was paid off massively and Corbett is, in my opinion, trying to make you more comfortable to more extreme ideas. 

When thinking critically, it's important to be especially critical of anything that flies in the face of scientific consensus. The ""Appeal to Authority"" fallacy essentially has an exception for consensus, because if you're disputing something that has a lot of evidence behind it, your evidence has to be spotless. When you see someone like Corbett cite Seitz saying that climate change is overblown, be incredibly fucking critical. You cited that article as if it had almost equal weight to scientific consensus, yet it took me two minutes to find out that, not only that Seitz wasn't a climatologist, but that *he was literally paid off by oil companies to write articles with fundamentalists.* You could easily have found that yourself if you had even bothered searching his name. So the first step to advocating that I or anyone else think critically about climate change or anything else, is to actually think critically yourself.

If you're saying you'd rather green energy shifts be publicly owned, then I absolutely agree. Energy should be nationalised. The blame falling to the public is another thing that special interests against the ""climate change agenda"" have pulled to shift blame to the population. Even if we all took the most drastic personal action, it wouldn't make enough of a difference without forcing oil and manufacturing companies to follow. Change has to come from the top, as it's essentially impossible to function in modern life, to get to work, etc, without the things that these companies have made with fossil fuels. Thus, the impetus is not on us to idk, buy only electric cars to save the environment until it gets popular enough that companies will focus on it, but to force companies now to *only* produce and develop electric cars that we then have to use. It's not on us to go without electricity entirely (though we should reduce), but up to Shell and the others to only invest in renewables from now on (or confiscate everything they have and do it ourselves).

> RationalWiki 

Yeah, I know, I don't really care for it. I just searched for the Corbett to see how controversial he is and see what other conspiracy stuff he's pedaling (chemtrails, 9/11 truthers, etc). I don't take it for truth, but it's useful and quick to see what other shit he's done, especially since he doesn't have a wikipedia page. Point being, if the rest of the stuff he reports on is like this, especially with thoroughly debunked stuff like 9/11 and chemtrails (literal conspiracy theories, rather than climate denial which is a conspiracy that is somehow widely accepted), then I have absolutely no reason to listen to him. He clearly isn't doing proper research, and the excuse of ""do it yourself"" isn't good enough when he's only researching the wrong side of a non-existent debate and providing some of the sketchiest sources I've ever seen. That's not how reporting works, he has to present actual facts if he's gonna pull the ""look into this more yourself if I've piqued your interest"". He's claiming to be a fucking journalist, the burden is on him to act like one and properly research the topics he covers. He's either too misguided to listen to or he's acting maliciously.

Capitalism took hundreds of years and many failed attempts to get off the ground before it displaced feudalism as the normal way of life, and it has indeed raised millions, if not billions, from poverty (Marx even acknowledges this). But it's clearly not doing enough, and a new way forward is definitely needed. Socialism as an ideology has been around for about 150 years, and has almost never been given a chance by capitalism to get off the ground (See: CIA coups in Iran, half the countries in South America who attempted to move to the left politically, and even being involved in deposing the prime minister of Australia for being left wing), so why insist that it'll fail every time when it's barely out of the gate? And even in it's most horrific, earliest attempts (USSR), you cannot say it wasn't effective at lifting people out of poverty. Russia was a feudalist state which had a Tsar with a lot of power supposedly appointed by god, and had massive famines and an incredibly impoverished population. Socialism took them from that to the second most powerful country on earth in twenty years, while being embargoed by everyone in the west and fighting a civil war who's opposition was backed by the US, Britain and France. Capitalism could only dream of such results. And that was making the jump straight from Feudalism, when Marx suggested that socialism would arise from capitalist failings, where the infrastructure for a socialist society (factories, etc) would already exist to be turned over to the workers.

And I disagree with that.  Going global is exactly how you work towards an economy that calculates externalities.  Climate change is the kick in the pants that might get us there if it doesn't take us out first.  It affects us all.

https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=p-MNSLsjjdo 

What your'e looking for is the Copenhagen interpretation of quantum mechanics.  You've probably seen / heard something along the lines of ""Schrödinger's cat"".

Theoretical physicist [Edward Witten](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Edward_Witten) was [interviewed](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hUW7n_h7MvQ) on the matter, in regards to consciousness - it's interesting to watch him dance around the topic.   He's not saying ""there's a god"" but he is saying there's a thing that living in our 3 dimensional space, we will likely never be able to measure, since we're akin to a 2d cartoon trying to measure 3d space, there aren't tools in our universe (that we know of, maybe not possible at all) that can measure what is required to understand the problem.

Also, If you subscribe to the ""many worlds""  interpretation of quantum mechanics, you get the multiverse possibility.  shows like Quantum leap and Sliders are based on that, and some of Marvels universe dabbles in this as well ( I think they mentioned it in the last Spider Man movie if I'm not mistaken). 

For me (in the field of AI), the biggest takeaway is the implications of this in AI research -> that modeling a human brain in software will not produce the same results as a organic, or synthetic brain will, thus requiring us to rethink any research in strong AI. 

>Hard to believe stretching space would not involve stretching time as well 

Another great takeaway of quantum mechanics (or maybe just theoretical physics in general) is that this is exactly what they think is possible.  So much science fiction has been around the idea of [worm holes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wormhole), otherwise known as an "" Einstein–Rosen bridge"".  FTA:  

>A wormhole could connect extremely long distances such as a billion light years or more, short distances such as a few meters, different universes, or different points in time.

It's a bit more complicated than that. Climate models are mathematical representations of the interactions between the atmosphere, oceans, land surface, ice and the sun. This is a very complex task, so models are built to estimate trends rather than events. For example, a climate model can tell you it will be cold in winter, but it can’t tell you what the temperature will be on a specific day, that’s weather forecasting. Climate trends are weather, averaged out over time, usually 30 years. Trends are important because they eliminate, or ""smooth out"", single events that may be extreme, but quite rare. 

Climate models have to be tested to find out if they work. We can’t wait for 30 years to see if a model is any good or not; models are tested against the past, against what we know happened. If a model can correctly predict trends from a starting point somewhere in the past, we could expect it to predict with reasonable certainty what might happen in the future. Models are also in a constant state of development to include more processes, rely on fewer approximations and increase their resolution as computer power develops. The complex and non-linear nature of climate means there will always be a process of refinement and improvement. The main point is the vast majority of the models that we do have agree with each other, and all point in a single, well defined direction.

>Climate change is real and has always been real

Yes, the climate has changed before, but you need to understand the difference between slow and abrupt changes. For example, life flourished in the Eocene, the Cretaceous and other times of high CO2 in the atmosphere because the greenhouse gasses were in balance with the carbon in the oceans and the weathering of rocks. Life, ocean chemistry, and atmospheric gasses had millions of years to adjust to those levels. But there have been several times in Earth’s past when Earth's temperature jumped abruptly, in much the same way as they are doing today. Those times were caused by large and rapid greenhouse gas emissions, just like humans are causing today.

Those abrupt global warming events were almost always highly destructive for life, causing mass extinctions such as at the end of the Permian, Triassic, or even mid-Cambrian periods. The symptoms from those events (a big, rapid jump in global temperatures, rising sea levels, and ocean acidification) are all happening today with human-caused climate change. So yes, the climate has changed before humans, and in most cases scientists know why. In all cases we see the same association between CO2 levels and global temperatures. And past examples of rapid carbon emissions (just like today) were generally highly destructive to life on Earth.

>There is no way to stop it.

If you don't accept the overwhelming amount of evidence that humans are responsible for this abrupt change then you might be right, but that is not what science has told us so far. Before the industrial revolution, the CO2 content in the air remained quite steady for thousands of years. Natural CO2 is not static, however. It is generated by natural processes, and absorbed by others. Natural land and ocean carbon remained roughly in balance and have done so for a long time, and we know this because we can measure historic levels of CO2 in the atmosphere both directly (in ice cores) and indirectly (through proxies). But consider what happens when more CO2 is released from outside of the natural carbon cycle, by burning fossil fuels. Although our output of 29 gigatons of CO2 is tiny compared to the 750 gigatons moving through the carbon cycle each year, it adds up because the land and ocean cannot absorb all of the extra CO2. About 40% of this additional CO2 is absorbed. The rest remains in the atmosphere, and as a consequence, atmospheric CO2 is at its highest level in 15 to 20 million years ([Tripati 2009](http://www.sciencemag.org/cgi/content/abstract/1178296)). A natural change of 100ppm normally takes 5,000 to 20,000 years. The recent increase of 100ppm has taken just 120 years.

Human CO2 emissions upset the natural balance of the carbon cycle. Man-made CO2 in the atmosphere has increased by a third since the pre-industrial era, creating an artificial forcing of global temperatures which is warming the planet. While fossil-fuel derived CO2 is a very small component of the global carbon cycle, the extra CO2 is cumulative because the natural carbon exchange cannot absorb all the additional CO2.",0.07007166,EMPTY,EMPtacular,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

No, I didnt, because your original attempt to argue was pointless. And so you've ignored my ""um rebuttal"" that was clearly establishing that my argument and your's we're in no way equal so as to be comparable.

> if your goal is to find the most fair and least burdensome distribution a flat tax isn't the answer. This is why there isn't sales tax in most European countries.

Here again you make a bold statement without evidence. You're statement implies that Europe doesnt have sales tax because its decided that flat tax is unfair and they've abolished its use by eliminating the use of sales tax. 
#1 Europe does utilize a sales tax (V.A.T) so I've no clue where your statement comes from.  https://taxfoundation.org/vat-rates-europe-2019/
#2 You literally said it yourself. Sales tax is, in effect, a flat tax. My point nearly proven. We've taken an economic philosophy and applied it, at least in part, to a specific usage. Originally I was arguing more toward an income tax, not sales tax, but overall I was simply stating that, as an economic philosophy, it has merit when applied properly and likely as a small part of larger economic policy. Which a sales tax slightly demonstrates. Now you're saying that most European countries choose not to have a sales tax because they dont like flat taxes. We see that statement is not necessarily true. I disagree that it anything to do with an aversion to a Fat Tax policy, but that's my personal perception. Now let's assume that were talking about a country that does avoid a sales tax because they do exist obviously. What youd find is that they likely generate revenue through higher taxes elsewhere. In the U.S. we have a number of states that choose to not have a sales tax. Useing Oregon for example: where Oregon chooses to not have a sales they have sky high property taxes to make up for the lost revenue. There's little doubt EU countries dont follow a similar pattern, choosing instead to generate their revenue through alternative taxes. But were getting far flung from my original statement. 

You're intent on attacking my intelligence and education, baselessly and without evidence clearly, for some reason instead of arguing the topic. It's usually a good indication that any real debate is over and this is going to devolve into either person simply trying to get the last word in.

No, for the most part they don't. You have no idea how businesses work. The owner had to initially purchase or lease those things. Being a worker you didn't have to pay for any of this stuff, therefore you do not deserve anything more than your time. Without the owner initially paying for everything needed to turn a profit, workers would not have been able to ""produce"" anything of value.

Here's another massive part of running a business that employees don't have to deal with : Monetary Risk. The initial investment required to start the business is a massive risk for a business owner. All that money could be lost in the process. What monetary risks are employees dealing with when working for a business? None. You stand to lose your job if you don't do it well enough, and even then you're not going to lose any earned money. 

> That's what unions do, but ultimately no salary is a fair salary.

You don't need unions to negotiate salary, and you are simply wrong. Many salaries are fair salaries. I agree though, some salaries are VERY unfair, like the salaries of our government workers who benefit from retirement pension plan paid for by the taxpayer. Having ME pay for YOUR retirement, yeah now THAT is unfair. Under socialism the whole thing would work like that and be unfair. Fairness is not the same thing as equality. Equality of outcome is unfair.

> All jobs are like that

No they aren't. You think they are, but they aren't. If all jobs were unfairly paid, almost no one would work anymore. Sadly for you and your weird little communist theory, most human beings see getting paid for your time as a fair deal. Wanna know something better? You only have yourself to blame for doing a deal you see as ""unfair"". Not the business owner, not society, not capitalism, only yourself. You are free to go do something else and get paid a different amount for your time if you feel your current job is unfair.

> Not interested in becoming the parasite.

Lmfao you really seem to hate the idea of business. Going as far as calling a business owner a ""parasite"" is a clear sign that you are in fact a commie. Forgetting the fact that small businesses exist, too, and with many of them unable to turn in a profit from time to time, who do you think eats up the costs? The ""poor and unfairly paid"" workers? Nope. It's the owner. What about small indie game developers who technically run their own businesses all alone? What about self employed youtubers and online content creators who work alone? Are they ""parasites"" too? I mean it's your word buddy, you said business owners are ""parasites"", so I guess ALL business owners are...

You seriously sound like a poor, jealous person who feels entitled to things you are not. You actually seem to believe ""socialism"" or increased government intervention in the lives of taxpayers to improve your living situation, which kinda leads me to believe you are the kind of person who leeches off social programs more than the average person.

The main argument that life flourished in the Eocene, the Cretaceous and other times of high CO2 in the atmosphere was because the greenhouse gasses were in balance with the carbon in the oceans and the weathering of rocks. Life, ocean chemistry, and atmospheric gasses had millions of years to adjust to those levels. But there have been several times in Earth’s past when Earth's temperature jumped rapidly, in much the same way as they are doing today. Those times were caused by [large and rapid greenhouse gas emissions](https://agupubs.onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/full/10.1002/2014PA002621), just like humans are causing today. In Earth's past the trigger for these greenhouse gas emissions was often unusually massive volcanic eruptions known as ""Large Igneous Provinces"" with knock-on effects that included huge releases of CO2 and methane from organic-rich sediments. But there is no Large Igneous Province operating today, or anytime in the last 16 million years. Today’s volcanoes, [in comparison](https://skepticalscience.com/volcanoes-and-global-warming.htm), don’t even come close to emitting the levels of greenhouse gasses that humans do. 

Those rapid global warming events were almost always [highly destructive](https://skepticalscience.com/Rapid-climate-change-deadlier-than-asteroid-impacts.html) for life, causing mass extinctions such as at the end of the Permian, Triassic, or even mid-Cambrian periods.

Correct me if I'm wrong.  Is the whole premise of CO2 causing warming to the air being dangerous because somehow eventually the ocean will get 2-5C hotter thereby melting all of the polar ice caps, killing all of the ocean life, and then eventually the melted ice would drown us all?

If you did, you will see that CO2 does a piss poor job at heating up any body of water.  Saying that a warm atmosphere would heat up a body of water is laughable for anyone with a background thermodynamics, physics, and chemistry.

No, you haven't shown anything noteworthy other than RationalWiki and Wikipedia. You're cherrypicking.

>He may say ""do your own research"", but the sources he provides are incredibly biased and he wants you to use them to craft a world view similar to his, which he knows most people won't do and they'll just say ""well he sources all his work!"". He knows most people will just take him at his word, especially if he says ""hey, the info's out there, I'm just bringing it to you. Go look at the sources I cited.

Again, Wikipedia and RationalWiki? Do beter.

>Either he knowingly and willingly gets his sources from someone like Seitz, and is therefore duplicitous and not to be trusted as a reporter, or he is ignorant enough to not know better and didn't do proper research on Seitz or the topic at hand, and as such isn't a good reporter.

You see, this is where your argument starts falling apart for me. Corbett never cited Seitz. Judith Curry did. You haven't read or watched anything I've shared, nor have you taken it seriously. Instead, you insist on screaming inside your echo chamber.

>As you can see, either way I'm really fine to ignore Corbett, 

Nope. 

>because he's either knowingly drumming up controversy or he's woefully misinformed to the point that his opinion and reporting on the matter is worthless. You will not learn to think critically from a source like him unless you *actually* do the research yourself,

You learn to think critically by looking at all the sources and making up your *own* mind.

> and generally come to the conclusion that most of what he says is completely wrong. He's a 9/11 truther for gods sake

So are a massive part of the US population; wanna throw them in the gulags too? Furthermore, plenty of whistleblowers that have had their lives *ruined* so people like you can keep screaming fake outrage in your echo chamber.

> and had white nationalist Stefan Molyneux on his show. He's like Alex Jones-lite, his opinion on any scientific topic is next to worthless, especially when he's pedaling shit like Seitz. He told you to go and research it yourself, so why didn't you? You took him at his word that he had a trustworthy source, and he clearly lied because I found that the guy he cited was a fraud.

They discussed:

*""Today we talk to Stefan Molyneux of* [*FreeDomainRadio.com*](http://www.freedomainradio.com/) *about his presentation series “*[*The Bomb in the Brain*](http://www.youtube.com/view_play_list?p=B3F2CF45EEB95C80)*” outlining the empirical evidence of the adverse effects of early childhood trauma. We discuss the phenomenon of epigenetics and the growing scientific understanding of the role environmental factors play in influencing one’s character, and talk about the reasons for optimism that peaceful parenting is gradually replacing irrational and abusive forms of child-rearing.""*

[*https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-675-stefan-molyneux-on-peaceful-parenting/*](https://www.corbettreport.com/interview-675-stefan-molyneux-on-peaceful-parenting/)

But don't listen, cos fuck freedom of speech, right?

Here's the other one:

*""*[*TragedyandHope.com*](https://www.tragedyandhope.com/) *presents a debate between* [*Stefan Molyneux*](http://www.freedomainradio.com/) *and Tom Wilcutts on the question, “Is government by its very nature immoral?” The debate is hosted by James Corbett of* [*The Corbett Report*](http://www.corbettreport.com/)*.""*

But again, don't listen, because freedom of speech is ruining us.

Now, I will admit this, cos I may be wrong, but I believe these interviews were conducted long before Molyneux was the controversial figure he is now - in 2013 - so I welcome correction, but I doubt that because of Corbett interviewing Molyneux you get to throw the baby out with the bathwater.

Also, as I stated above, you totally got the Seitz thing wrong in attempting to bring Corbett into disrepute.

>My point here was that there is plenty of evidence to show that climate scepticism and government apathy is bought by the corporations who benefit from it, just as UFC benefited from bribing the CIA. 

Of course there is! It's called democratic capitalism! Are you suggesting that that the climate change narrative can not (or has not) be (been) coopted for exactly the same reasons!? Isn't that incredibly gullible? And, if so, who will pay for that - your or the big evil governments and corporations!? Who will truly be played for the fool?

>You can't flip it around, because there's no special interest who benefits from arguing we should do something about climate change, 

So... Green energy corporations (read, likely Shell, BP, etc. because they're smarter, bigger and infinitely more powerful than your opinion), lobby groups, government officials, etc. cannot benefit from your carbon tax and Green New Deal!? OkAy BrO.

>while there demonstrably are numerous special interests who benefit from there being a debate around a subject that there shouldn't be a debate around due to the science being settled.

In science, the grain is almost always right, and the people going against it should, unless they have very good evidence for what they say, should be laughed out of town.

*Didn't you just say ""\[s\]cience is questioned literally every day by the scientists doing it.""* If you just dismiss the evidence out of hand, without providing anything counter... I don't know where we go from ehre?

>This really boils down to a deeper problem that I have with Corbett and others like him. Corbett isn't really trying to make you think critically. He's trying, and apparently succeeding, to make you paranoid of things that have a deep scientific backing in order to make you then more easy to manipulate to other ideas, and disguising it as ""we over here use logic and reason"". The climate scientists were lying? Step it up a notch. Black people caused their own problems and institutionalised racism doesn't exist? Keep going. 9/11 was the government? a little bit more... Jews run the banks and need killing? Ah. There you are. From sceptic to fascist in a few simple steps.

You do know that that is just a *shit ton of conjecture,* right!?

> Here lies the pipeline of the Alt-Right and associated movements. You start by finding something that presents dubious evidence for climate scepticism, and you move on to harder and more racist things. Corbett probably isn't a fascist, but he sure as hell is a gateway to people like Molyneux who are, and does them favours by getting them on his show.

Have you even *watched* any of the stuff you dispute so heavily!? Or are you just assuming that IF = MOLYNEUX THEN EVERYTHING IS BS!? Remember when the US went to war because WMDs? Me too.

>And I know this because I almost got sucked in. Five years ago or so I was watching all this shit, Sargon of Akkad, looking at tumblrinaction, gamergate, etc, and was probably not too far from falling into that kind of pit of what I just mentioned. I can't remember what pulled me out, but looking back it's clear that it was a pretty dangerous edge. And I don't want it to happen to you. 

Okay, if you're actually being sincere, I appreciate it. But I live in South Africa, so (on an aside) I have seen the world the left in America hopes for first hand. Believe me, it's *not* the world you want. I fucking *promise* you.

>You can see numerous examples of people this did happen to all over reddit. They try to act like they're thinking so critically, but then they cite their main sources as Ben Shapiro or Steven Crowder or something, people who have no right to have any influence over the climate debate, and do the exact same thing Corbett is doing here with climate change and a number of different topics.

Have you actually, *ever* critically considered Corbett before I mentioned him today? Be honest.

>If you want to think critically, then be especially critical of the news sources telling you to think critically, because as I said, normally they just want you to become paranoid about some global ""leftist"" conspiracy that doesn't exist. Thinking critically does not mean ""question literally everything, even stuff I know nothing about"". It's recognising and working out if whoever is presenting it to you has an agenda. The scientists researching climate change have no agenda other than trying to save the planet. 

That is *incredibly* naive. Everybody has an agenda.

>They've presented 60 years of data which supports their conclusion.

This is largely part of the problem; they discount hundreds, thousands of years of data before industrialisation.

> People like Seitz, and Corbett who cites him, have an agenda. Seitz was paid off massively and Corbett is, in my opinion, trying to make you more comfortable to more extreme ideas.

As I have proven, he never cited Seitz. You didn't read my post properly.

>When thinking critically, it's important to be especially critical of anything that flies in the face of scientific consensus. The ""Appeal to Authority"" fallacy does not apply consensus, because a consensus has evidence behind it,

Like those who said ""WMD's LET'S HAVE A WAR!""

> while Appeal to Authority is just saying ""listen to this person because they're in x position"".

Like the IPCC?

> If you're disputing something that has a lot of evidence behind it, your evidence has to be spotless.

And the IPCC's is? Therefore nobody is allowed to *question* them?

> When you see someone like Corbett cite Seitz saying that climate change is overblown, be incredibly fucking critical.

Yeah... He didn't.

> You cited that article as if it had almost equal weight to scientific consensus, yet it took me two minutes to find out that, not only that Seitz wasn't a climatologist, but that *he was literally paid off by oil companies to write articles with fundamentalists.* You could easily have found that yourself if you had even bothered searching his name. So the first step to advocating that I or anyone else think critically about climate change or anything else, is to actually think critically yourself.

Fair, I will own that, but it's part of a far larger article with a lot more sources, and again, I'm the first to admit that I do *not* understand nor necessarily appreciate all of this completely, but I also don't wholesale buy into the ""the end is nigh"" narrative, because the end has been nigh since the dawn of time, and we're still here, and in many ways, the human race is doing far, *far* better than it ever has, at least insofar as I can tell.",0.6519473,EMPTY,EyeGod,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

That's my country. We had rolling blackouts today, so, unless your government is incorruptible, I'm not so sure.

> The blame falling to the public is another thing that special interests against the ""climate change agenda"" have pulled to shift blame to the population. Even if we all took the most drastic personal action, it wouldn't make enough of a difference without forcing oil and manufacturing companies to follow. Change has to come from the top, as it's essentially impossible to function in modern life, to get to work, etc, without the things that these companies have made with fossil fuels. Thus, the impetus is not on us to idk, buy only electric cars to save the environment until it gets popular enough that companies will focus on it, but to force companies now to *only* produce and develop electric cars that we then have to use. It's not on us to go without electricity entirely (though we should reduce), but up to Shell and the others to only invest in renewables from now on (or confiscate everything they have and do it ourselves).

Honestly... You're gonna trust a multinational corporation to do that? How? People are simply too comfortable or lazy. Even you: do you eat meat? Watch TV? Fly? Drive a car?

>At least she's a climatologist and doesn't actually seem to disagree with consensus, just thinks for some reason that we should let everyone have a go at it, which again is not how you do science.

Because if the globular consensus labels a thing as ""THIS"" it must be ""THIS"", and we dare not question that fact? Remember way back when they believed the earth was flat, but someone was convinced it was round? Yep, me too.

> If people can present the scientific community with good evidence to be sceptical about climate change, then they'll accept it.

Only if they're 100% incorruptible. Are you honestly naive enough to think they will not turn their back on an easy buck, or that research grant, or that ego-boosting peer reviewed paper or tenure at some university?

> But papers written by material scientists and astrophysicists that are roundly torn apart do not meet that threshold.

Yes. And before someone proved the earth was round, everyone believed it to be flat.

Look, man, I believed in climate change for a long ass time: stopped eating meat, recycled, tried to be as green as possible. And it just keeps getting worse; it's just doom and gloom all the time. I can simply no longer believe that it's that bad because Greta Thunberg says so and it makes everyone *feel* things on social media, or because the same shit peddlers that have been telling us we'd be dead by unless we introduce population control - yes, eugenics - ever since the fucking 50s or 60s because of global warming or whatever other manufactured scare tactic is the order of the day without *actually* questioning the official narrative... I'll just walk away with this:  


***“The conscious and intelligent manipulation of the organized habits and opinions of the masses is an important element in democratic society. Those who manipulate this unseen mechanism of society constitute an invisible government which is the true ruling power of our country. … We are governed, our minds are molded, our tastes formed, our ideas suggested, largely by men we have never heard of. This is a logical result of the way in which our democratic society is organized. Vast numbers of human beings must cooperate in this manner if they are to live together as a smoothly functioning society. … In almost every act of our daily lives, whether in the sphere of politics or business, in our social conduct or our ethical thinking, we are dominated by the relatively small number of persons … who understand the mental processes and social patterns of the masses. It is they who pull the wires which control the public mind.”***

1571251444.0,1571251454.2475574,f3ybeak,"Just wanted to weigh in as an environmental engineer that has worked in the oil and gas industry. The first thing people need to understand is that there is no scenario where we suddenly make the switch from fossil fuels to renewables over night. There's a few factors impacting this, the first one is the rapid growth of population and energy demand. Populations around the world are growing at an exponential rate and the quality of life of individuals is also improving rapidly (as quality of life improves people usually lead way more energy intensive lifestyles). This energy demand needs to be met. Which leads us to the second problem, how will we meet it? There are a number of problems that hinder the ability of renewables to fully meet our energy demand. If be happy to go into more if anyone cares to read this far, but for now I'll discuss the battery problem. Wind and solar energy needs a way to be stored for times when there's no wind or sun. We use batteries for this but battery technology has limitations in how much power it can store and how long it can store it for, and storing it at all in harsh conditions. In addition to this batteries are very expensive and VERY environmentally unfriendly to produce. All these factors limiting renewables mean that as we work to perfect renewable tech there will be a growing demand for fossil fuels going into the next few decades to meet this demand. This is essentially what the CEO is saying here, but I'll touch more on that in a minute. So the question becomes if there will be more fossil fuels being used, how can we limit their emissions as much as possible. We can do this in many ways (eliminate bunker fuels, replace coal power plants with natarul gas). My personal opinion is that we need policy to force these massive oil and gas companies to allocate a large portion of their profits into research and development of renewable energy. But then we hit a bigger problem, shell is the largest publicly traded oil and gas company in the world, and it only produces about 3% of the world's oil. The state run Saudi, Chinese, russian, Iranian etc. Oil companies produce MULTITUDES more oil than these american/European based publicly traded companies and they make shell look like a environmental NGO in comparison of how polluting they are in the environment. Shell has multiple wind and solar farms, is starting to allocate higher and higher percentages of it's budget towards renewable sources, and has pledged to reduce it's carbon emmisions by 50% in the coming years. Again this is just my opinion, but we need to focus our efforts on a more global scale to perfect renewable tech and make a joint effort towards the energy transition. Otherwise if we just focus on a single company, in this case shell, we are just changing who is supplying the oil, nothing else really. Sorry about the long rant, I was just reading through the comments on this thread and wanted to give my two cents as well. Tldr, oil and gas will still be required in the future, if companies like shell don't produce it much worse companies will is essentially what the article is saying",0.09471395,EMPTY,dukedevilin,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

You can talk all you want about voter suppression but there is a reason California won't go to proportional electoral distribution. In 2016, 4.5 million people in California voted for President Trump DESPITE knowing their vote doesn't matter.

Why are you singling out a single state?  Trump lost the popular vote.  If districts were fairly apportioned and electoral votes were all worth the same amount, someone else would have won in 2016.  

That's the problem.  You can use piecemeal and slanted arguments all you want: at the end of the day, you're still just trying to justify a system that tweaks the election process so that a loser can win.  

So that someone supported by a *minority of voters* can win.  

>No the fact a candidate can win 10 of 11 of the largest states and win is not irrelevant. You said they only need to win 10 small states which is not the case. Don't start backpedaling now.

I compared the electoral votes of California to the sum of x smaller states.  You couldn't win an election with only California *plus* ten small states, versus the other 39 states, so I really don't know what you're going for here.  You either didn't get the analogy or are intentionally butchering it for a ""gotcha"" moment.  Either way, I'm not having it.  

>The president isn't some Supreme Leader. He is limited by the Constitution. 

Changing the subject a bit, eh?  

Either way, the current POTUS clearly thinks he's above the Constitution.  Judges are having to put him in his place.  

>In a filing to a federal court in New York, the Trump legal team, including Marc Mukasey, a son of Michael Mukasey, who served as Attorney General during the George W. Bush Administration, argued that, under the U.S. Constitution, a sitting President can’t be subjected to any criminal investigation except as part of an impeachment inquiry. The team’s argument was not merely that Trump can’t be hauled into court and prosecuted—a claim that now has the imprimatur of the U.S. Department of Justice—but that a President can’t be subjected to any type of “criminal process,” because it would “distract him from his constitutional duties.”

>A number of independent legal experts quickly pointed out that Trump’s lawyers were trying to rewrite the Constitution to create a whole new layer of executive protection and privilege. 

>“Bared to its core, the proposition the President advances reduces to the very notion that the Founders rejected at the inception of the Republic, and that the Supreme Court has since unequivocally repudiated: that a constitutional domain exists in this country in which not only the President, but, derivatively, relatives and persons and business entities associated with him in potentially unlawful private activities, are in fact above the law,” Marrero stated. “Because this Court finds aspects of such a doctrine repugnant to the nation’s governmental structure and constitutional values, and for the reasons further stated below, it ABSTAINS from adjudicating this dispute and DISMISSES the President’s suit.”

The whole point of the system is that it's nearly impossible to police over a billion citizens. So you try to make them police themselves and each other.

For the Chinese, reputation or face is key to making their way through life. It's like networking, having your reputation damaged isn't simply embarrassing, it impacts your ability to leverage your relationships for personal and professional success. 

>**Even phone dial tones will indicate whether or not the person on the other end is a “dishonest debtor”.** 

The article doesn't make much out of this line. But it's the heart of the social credit system really. People who misbehave in a way that doesn't directly harm the public are a big burden on any society.

Informing a person's friends, family and business relations of embarrassing facts like unpaid fines and debts is a huge motivator in China because it would impact a Chinese person's life far more extensively than it would impact a Westerner. 

Exposing people's bad habits to damage their reputation is a much more significant part of the social credit system than things like throttling internet access or limiting public transport access. After all, the whole point is to turn people into self-solving problems instead of government problems. Avoiding loss of face is a motivator. Having your ability to fix your problems sabotaged by not being able to use infrastructure just turns a person into a bigger problem.

Because saying climate change originated due to humanity is inherently and categorically false, unless you want to claim that we cause the last 4 ice ages over the past 500,000 years.  So if that’s the hill they’ll die on then I’ll agree with the 500 scientists who can see that climate change had been happening is the Gaia Thiea collision. 

Now, ignoring the crackpots, the real debate should be to what effect are we having on climate, and what will the long term effect be, which there is absolutely no consensus right now. Models and projections changed every 5-10 years for the past 50 years and nobody has got it right.

So who is the regulating body that determines who a “climate scientist “ is, because it seems like a self proclaimed title that only people who want to get caught up in the drama take.  As for speaking to professors I’ve done lots of that, one of my mentors was a meteorologist for 50 years with a PhD in Atmospheric Science.  And like me, he agreed that humans are having an impact on climate change, but nobody knows exactly how severe or what the outcome of that change will be, or if it will even have a massive impact on humanity before we experience another ice age.  

Because here’s the thing, historically, before every ice age the planet goes through an intense phase of warming, and well put CO2 levels are currently higher that the limited record we have, what we do know for certain is exactly how hot the temperature for before the ice age started.  But I can tell you one thing, as temperatures increase more moisture can be evaporated into the air, meaning more moisture is carried to high altitudes, and more snow and precipitation.  So eventually we’ll hit a tipping point where the temperature hits a saturation point where it will constantly carry snow into the northern hemisphere, which is how the cooling cycle starts.  We have records of it happening 5 times in the past 450k years. So whether we swing our dicks all day and argue about whether or not we accelerated that cycle by 50 or 100 years, it’s an inevitable change, the scientific community should be more concerned about how we can survive climate change, not how we can stop it.

I have a feeling that the consequences of this will be much worse for China than the one child policy ever was. (reminder - China is living with the consequences of this and will take a generation to get through it.) 

So how will this play out? I would suggest that the wealthy will quickly find a way to buy social credit scores and so (as long as they don't conflict with those more wealthy than they are) will find their lives largely unchanged. Those unable to buy social credit will find not only that they have to behave but also that they are unable to complain about anything. The medium term results of this will be rampant environmental damage and probably a couple of mass-poisonings that will be swept under the carpet. As time goes on there will be a class of workers too good and timid to criticise the ruling class which will lead to a great lack of critical thinking and an underclass of people with nothing to loose. The underclass is likely to be very disaffected. If CCP chooses to deal with them in the CCP way - by interning them and harvesting their organs - then all of those disaffected people will be someones father, brother, lover or son.

I suppose there will be procedures to give up custody of the embryo/fetus, allowing for someone else to claim it and foster its development. Perhaps the methods for freezing eggs and embryos will advance to a point which allows for preserving the embryo/fetus after the point that a pregnancy test is able to detect the pregnancy. 

With this technology, people who would terminate the pregnancy due to it not being the right time would have the option of waiting until the time is right, or giving up custody.

Realistically though, this stuff is going to be really expensive. Perhaps in cases of wanted pregnancy and life risk, the family might pull together the necessary money. It could be a whole new category on crowdfunding sites. But freezing an embryo for later isn't exactly cheap, so freezing an embryo/fetus for later use likely won't be too common.

Least common will be adoption of embryos or fetuses, because artifical wombs are going to be very expensive.

They have half a dozen experimental social credit systems in as many different cities.

The one thing all of them have in common is that these systems are meant to relief law enforcement by making people police themselves. And this is done by leveraging the importance the Chinese place on 'face' or reputation.

Saving face is hugely important in China. A person's reputation is their means towards personal and professional success. As a result, threatening someone's reputation is a very effective motivator.

Western media keep describing the social credit systems from a Western perspective. But our culture is too different to make sense of it from that perspective. Imagine if you phoned me and before you got me on the line, you'd hear a message stating that I haven't paid my bills and you should remind me of that.

Why is China against Uyghurs? 

Chinese officials are concerned that Uighurs hold extremist and separatist ideas, and they view the camps as a way of eliminating threats to China’s territorial integrity, government, and population. Arbitrary detention became widely used by regional officials under Chen Quanguo, Xinjiang’s Communist Party secretary, who moved to the province in 2016 after holding a top leadership position in Tibet. Known for increasing the number of police and security checkpoints, as well as state control over Buddhist monasteries in Tibet, Chen has since dramatically intensified security in Xinjiang. He is known for turning China’s regions into police states under 24/7 AI and CCTV [Surveillance]( https://www.economist.com/briefing/2018/05/31/china-has-turned-xinjiang-into-a-police-state-like-no-other)

The biggest push against the Uyghurs started in February 2017 after a knife attack left [8 dead in the Xinjiang province]( https://www.bbc.com/news/world-asia-38977724). However no motive was given for the action of the 3 (killed) assailants, but the government blamed Muslim separatists for the attack . Shortly after a gruesome [Isis video surfaced depicting Uighur fighters in Iraq calling for attacks on China – FT article. NO VIDEO]( https://www.ft.com/content/ddeb5872-ff1f-11e6-96f8-3700c5664d30). “In retaliation for the tears that flow from the eyes of the oppressed we will make your blood flow in rivers, by the will of God,” says one fighter featured in the video, speaking in Uighur. The video is not the first Isis effort to attract Uighur recruits and the group has appealed to some Uighurs’ aspirations for their own nation of “East Turkestan”. However, historic animosity between Arabic and Turkic speakers tends to limit the allure of Isis for Uighurs. In 2015 Isis executed three Uighur fighters who were attempting to desert its forces in Syria, Chinese newspaper Global Times reported.  Chinese experts estimate that roughly *100 Chinese citizens have joined Isis in Syria*. Not all are Uighurs. The Chinese government has suggested the number could be as high as 300, while other sources have pegged the number closer to 100.

According to the ICCT report about the [Uighur Foreign Fighters (UFF)]( https://icct.nl/wp-content/uploads/2017/11/ClarkeKan-Uighur-Foreign-Fighters-An-Underexamined-Jihadist-Challenge-Nov-2017-1.pdf) there were multiple terror attacks in China attributed to the UFF that China uses as an excuse – 

* October 2013: ETIM attack at Tiananmen Square in Beijing kills five.
* February 2014: A knife attack at a train station in Kunming kills 30
* April 2014: A knife and bomb attack at the South Railway Station of Urumqi kills three and wounds 79
* May 2014: Two cars crashed into a market and the attackers lobbed explosives, killing 31 people in Urumqi
* September 2014: Bomb blasts (including suicide bombers) and clashes left 50 people dead and 50 injured.
* October 2015: A knife attack on a coalmine kills 50

1. On the International arena, prioritizing their economic ties and strategic relationships with China, many governments have ignored the human rights abuses. In July 2019, after a group of mostly European countries—and no Muslim-majority countries—signed a letter to the UN human rights chief condemning China’s actions in Xinjiang, more than three dozen states, including Pakistan and Saudi Arabia, signed their own letter praising China’s “remarkable achievements” in human rights and its “counterterrorism” efforts in Xinjiang.

Additionally, China is moving beyond Uyghur and cracking down on its model minority [Hui Muslim]( https://www.npr.org/2019/09/26/763356996/afraid-we-will-become-the-next-xinjiang-chinas-hui-muslims-face-crackdown).

Honestly, not a lot gets out of China. They have a firewall not to protect what gets in but what gets out. That’s what makes things kinda freaky. Like what is going on inside the borders?

A lot of other countries don’t have that. China being one of those countries.

The answer is, we have almost fully exhausted all hydroelectric power in the United States. That is, wherever we have the ability to extract energy from the flow of water, and the ability to install facilities to extract that power, we have already done so. Any future advancements in this area will be very small compared to history.

So what about wind power? Well when power is proving not to be as fruitful as hoped. There are still lots of options, but not every place weather and conditions conducive to even installing these.

So what about solar? Well in my opinion, solar is one of the best Solutions. However, where it is most viable is in the Southwest. And other places, where there is more rain, snow, or place is further north that simply get less direct sunlight, solar is a huge problem. And building transmission lines to travel these kinds of distances result in significant energy loss, I would require transmission upgrades if you even wanted to attempt to feed surrounding states with Southern solar panels.

What I'm trying to say is that, wherever possible, they've already installed renewable energy where it was easy to do so. Where was most cost-effective to do so.

Then you move on to places where it is less cost-effective. Then you move on to places where it is even less cost-effective. As time goes on, your rate of return goes down and down, and progress slows.

Why are you talking about 2000 years when the activity that causes this problem (masses release of carbon in the form of burning coal and oil) began only 100 year ago? Do you see how fraudulent this statement is? It's entirely possible that ""it"" (whatever ""it"" is, you don't say...) could have been ""dropping on average over the last 2000 years"" and ALSO rising SHARPLY over the last 100 years.

Yeah except that's not happening. That's what should be happening but it's not... and that would play out over a thousand years or more, what I am talking about is occurring MUCH more rapidly.

>During an ice age CO2 levels dramatically fall as does plant growth which is necessary for photosynthesis.

Absent humans... humans have put have 100 MILLION years worth of previously sequestered carbon back into the atmosphere in only about 100 years. Odd that every denier ignores this when I say it every time I talk about this topic.

This graph ends in 2000 when atmospheric CO2 concentration was at ~380ppm... we are at ~420ppm today... imagine that extending that line up past the top of the graph...

Most people are not trying to get away with doing less, and, at least in my experience, feel the most satisfied and secure when they are working hard and creating visible products of their labor.
When I've seen ""things go side ways"" it's almost exclusively at higher levels of management when politics create goals other than ""create an amazing product"".

There are no companies that have failed because the workers have finally figured out how to sneak their way out of doing work. But workers do have a hard time being productive when ""productivity"" is some weird game that no one will really explain the rules to.

>I am just in awe that you think the way a country is being ran can be objectively anything

So if a country implemented a policy to reduce homelessness and the policy increased homelessness that would just be an opinion would it?

For example,

The UK has been pushing out an all in one universal credit scheme to make social assistance payments easier to manage, it has resulted in such large delays in payouts that homelessness has increased. Landlords are refusing to house anyone on the benefits scheme as delays result in people not paying on time.

That is an objectively bad policy.

>It's all relative.

relative to what? What you're suggesting is any idea, no matter how absurdly stupid and damaging, can be given a positive spin by comparing it to a worse idea.

We should all adopt communism because it works better than a political system where everyone is forced to kill themselves at the age of 25.

No system is perfect, this is not a flaw in my argument, its the cornerstone of my argument.

Democracy, or for lack of a better word, dynamic politics, allows vastly different political idea's to be applied to solving issues like homelessness, The problem with china is it has no dynamic politics, it has communism and only communism, it does not allow for any other form of politics and therefore does not allow for any otrher form of problem-solving.

Lets be honest, in practical terms this is effectively the same thing. We shouldn't ignore the fact that in a capitalist system your wealth is your identity in many ways. What you can afford to do defines where you're allowed to be. Not to mention many landlords will exhibit prejudices about your lifestyle, if you're perceived as ""stable"" regardless of your credit rating. And in competitive housing markets this does act to exclude people. Gentrification is an old criticism of a system that evicts people from their own neighbourhood because the owners want better people, people who are of a different class because they have more money.

Those are real factors in our systems and we've responded to them in many ways as a result. We also like to be in denial about it despite often using the same awareness of capitalism as a sytem being an apparent engine of eliminating poverty. But there are reasons we have rights for tenants, rights for workers, etc. Because we know the system without those protections creates imbalances of power that cut across class lines.

Once the tobacco industry lost their landmark case in the 90's, tobacco industry lobbyists either moved to China to get 1/3 of their population addicted to cigarettes, or they stayed in America and took the same playbooks they developed (to sow discord and cast doubt on the science linking tobacco products to cancer) and applied it to cast doubt on the science of climate change, and how anthropogenic carbon emissions are directly related to the warming trends we observe now. Now we are feeling the effects of secondhand smoke on a global scale. 

These lobbyists were VERY successful at creating a denialism movement to counter environmental progress, and Exxon even went as far as to try and calculate how much of global warming they could be held liable and responsible for in the event that they faced litigation.

You simply cannot pin our warming solely on natural causes. Yes, solar output has an effect. Yes, there are natural cycles of cooling and warming - and we are in an interglacial period. But CO2 (and other greenhouse gases our modern activities emit, such as methane, nitrous oxide, and refrigerants) is directly responsible for trapping excess infrared radiation that is causing an accelerated pace of warming that natural cycles alone cannot explain.  


Climate change awareness isn't scientists politicizing anything. Scientists try to stay away from politics for the most part and are perfectly content outside of the spotlight. Your argument above is pretty much the same one that Michael Crichton made in his epilogue of the book ""State of Fear,"" where he compared global warming research to eugenicists of the early 20th century and claimed it was a contemporary cash-grabbing zeitgeist farce in the name of acquiring grant money under false pretenses.

Few Industries in India have been identified as energy-intensive industries. These are Aluminum, cement, fertilizer, iron and steel, glass, and paper. Together they account for 17% of manufacturing value of output (VO) and for 39% of all fuels consumed in the manufacturing sector.

Cement industry is one of the most energy intensive industries, and energy costs account for a significant percentage (approximately 30-40 per cent) of the total manufacturing cost.

The annual energy consumption by cement industry contributes close to 10 per cent of the total energy consumed in entire industrial sector.

According to the Cement Manufacturers' Association, modern cement plants consume 68-93 units to produce a ton of cement while the older ones use up 110-120 units of electrical energy.

The cement industry has nearly 4,000 MW of installed captive power capacity, including coal-based plants, diesel generating sets and wind turbines to overcome rising power costs and uncertainty over supply.

Presently, the industry average for Captive Thermal Power generation cost varies between Rs. 3.50 to 4.50 / kWh and most plants are operating at around 30% efficiency.

The major problem of the cement industry are related to “power availability” that includes drastic cut in the electricity, shortage of coal, inadequate availability of wagons for transport, limited availability of furnace oil.

Some cement producers like Madras Cements, have put up captive power plants to take care of all their electricity requirements, while for others, such as ACC Ltd, captive power meets 72 per cent of its requirement.

The carbon footprint is nearly 1.3 kg/kWh for Captive Thermal Power plants in India. The overall CO2 emission is 866 kg/ ton clinker produced. The CO2 emission is around 670 kg/ ton of cement (PPC).

Sustainability in Cement Industry
Climate change and energy security are global challenges and cement industry recognizes the need to contribute its equitable effort as a function of its techno-economic and socio-economic development.

The cement industry recognizes the significant threat caused by climate change and focuses to develop its own renewable energy assets. This supports the vision to complement the existing power resourcing strategy with green power, efficient energy use planning and investment for better returns with sustainable energy growth.

India has joined hands with Switzerland to reduce energy consumption and develop newer methods in the Country for more efficient cement production, which would help India, meet its rising demand for cement in the infrastructure sector.

An enormous energy saving is possible in cement sector by implementing the renewable energy sources especially Waste heat recovery and solar energy plants that reduce operating cost and improve the environment.

Potential Renewable Energy Projects in Cement Plant
The Indian cement industry has realized that strong business growth can be achieved by sustaining manufacturing in an eco-friendly manner. Most of the new cement plants are adopting green processes and green power generation to reduce Green-House-Gas (GHG) emissions. Some of the following renewable energy projects can be introduced in the cement plant to achieve clean and green plant.

Power plants based on renewable sources such as wind and solar energy has a great potential to become an integral part of new cement plants.

1.  Waste Heat Recovery System (WHRS)
WHRS has a potential to generate about 20% to 30% of plant power requirements (reducing purchased/captive power needs). It uses hot gases from the clinker cooler or pre-heater to heat a liquid and generate steam, to generate in turn electricity for powering the cement plant. The power generation methods in WHRS work on Steam Rankine cycle, Organic Rankine cycle and Kalina cycle.

According to IFC (World Bank Group) report, the existing WHR installed capacity is more than 200 MW in India and there is potential to achieve remaining 500-900 MW with estimated investment potential of $1.4 billion.

2.  Solar Power Plant
Solar energy has many merits compared to conventional power sources. The solar prices have been falling, and in many parts of India, the cost of solar power is less than the tariff of power for the industrial sector.

Since the solar plants have a lifetime of typically 25 years, the energy prices are locked in, unlike in the case of power from utility companies, which is only expected to increase every year.

By installing solar power plants and solar water heating systems, cement plants can not only meet the obligations under both RPO and PAT mechanisms, but also reduce greenhouse gas (GHG) emissions.

Most cement plants in India are located in dry and hot areas with enormous solar radiation and have huge amounts of unused, un-shaded arid land. This makes cement sector very ideal for deployment of solar power generation plants. Solar energy can be harnessed either by Solar PV or Solar Thermal (CSP-Concentrated Solar Power) Technologies.

Based on the available area within a cement plant, we can install the solar power plant considering the solar technology suitable for that geographical terrain.

Some of the potential applications of solar energy in cement plants are listed below:

Roof top solar PV panels to meet the power requirement of CCR, Admin buildings, remote lighting applications like mines
Lighting requirements in Non-Plant Buildings, Internal roads, pumping water, guesthouse, township, parks, canteen, hospital, school and many more
Energy requirement of auxiliary equipment, utilities
Preheating of boiler feed water or raw materials

In the forests of central Sweden, construction is about to begin on a giant wind farm with a single purpose: to supply power to the aluminium smelters of Norsk Hydro, one of the world’s biggest producers, for the next 29 years.

The wind farm, which cost €270m to build, highlights an important development in renewable energy — a growing number of investments from heavy industry.

Recent deals from cement plants and aluminium smelters signal how a market is developing for renewable energy, particularly during a time of volatility for traditional energy prices, as some of the world’s most carbon-intensive industries try to go green.

“Industrial players are going to have a huge role, a pivotal role in the development of renewables in the future,” said Mark Dooley, head of green energy at Macquarie Capital and the Green Investment Group, one of the developers of the wind farm.

“Most large-scale industrial businesses are enormous consumers of power,” he added. “We think that, while it makes sense that an aluminium producer is in the vanguard, there is every reason to expect that all heavy industrial will follow.”

Corporate buyers of renewable power have been on the rise and emerged as one of the main drivers for new renewables projects, because long-term power supply deals typically enable construction to begin on a large wind or solar project.


FT Guide: the energy transition

Tech companies such as Microsoft and Amazon, which have big data centre power needs, were among the first to do these deals. But the trend has now spread across sectors and even to heavy industry, which has been one of the slowest sectors to decarbonise.

The Overturingen wind farm being built in central Sweden is a good example of how this works. Consisting of 56 Siemens Gamesa turbines — at 220m, they are each as tall as a 68-storey building — the wind farm will sell power into the electric grid, which will then supply the aluminium smelters on the west coast of Norway.

The intermittent wind power will be complemented by hydropower stations, which can adjust their output levels through the 24-hour, day-ahead bidding system that governs the Nordic power market.

Arvid Moss, vice-president of energy at Norsk Hydro, said the low price and long duration of the wind power contract made it ideal for aluminium smelters.

“Power cost is roughly one-third of the cost of producing primary aluminium, so we are working very hard to reduce this,” Mr Moss said. “Now in Sweden and Norway, wind power is definitely cost-competitive with large hydropower.”

By 2021, about 30 per cent of the power used in Norsk Hydro’s aluminium smelters would come from wind power, he added.

Other industrial sectors are starting to make similar moves. Earlier this month Acwa Power, the Saudi Arabian power company, inaugurated a wind project in northern Morocco that will supply electricity to three cement kilns nearby.

And in Sweden, construction began last month on a pilot plant to produce “green steel”. The plant, operated by SSAB, LKAB and Vattenfall, will use renewable energy and hydrogen to produce iron ore pellets without using fossil fuels.

The industrial sector is responsible for more than a fifth of global greenhouse gas emissions, according to data from the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change, but the sector has struggled to reduce its emissions.

One challenge is that many industrial processes do not directly use electricity. For example, only 10 to 15 per cent of a cement plant’s energy demand is for electricity. Most of the energy needed is in the form of heat — usually from burning coal or gas — to power the cement kiln.

At present, the technology does not exist to use electricity to heat a cement kiln in an economically feasible way, said Bernard Mathieu, director of climate change at the World Cement Association.

However, Mr Mathieu expects more renewables developments in the sector. “The electrification of energy intensive industry is on the agenda,” he said. “And in parallel we see, slowly but surely, a development of projects working with energy from renewable sources and investing in their own renewable production.”

Renewables: power move
Paddy Padmanathan, chief executive of Acwa power, said generating steam from wind and solar farms, rather than generating electricity, could be one way to help integrate more renewables into industrial plants.

“There are a lot of industrial processes that use steam — a lot of them use low-grade steam, which is perfect to be captured by these parabolic troughs that we are using,” he said, referring to concentrated solar plants that use the power of the sun to heat a liquid.

Other industrial plants may burn biomass or waste to produce heat, when electrification is not feasible.

Mr Padmanathan said the cement wind deal in Morocco was driven by the low cost of energy produced by renewables. “In Morocco, we are delivering energy to the cement plant at 20 per cent less than they can buy from the grid,” he said. “They get price certainty that is locked in over the long term.”

While the cement plants do not solely rely on wind power — they also draw electricity from the grid, particularly on calm days — securing a long-term wind power agreement allows them to hedge against the volatility of fossil fuel prices, which can be particularly acute in an energy-importing country such as Morocco.",0.06829496,EMPTY,Surur,t5_2t7no,not_available,not_available

You are correct that EMS is quite fast in urban areas, but it is still not fast enough for cardiac arrest, which is one of the reasons why survival rates have stagnated between 5-10% for the last 10+ years. That's the main motivation for this work - I think we need to think outside the box to make meaningful improvements in survival rates (and that doesn't just include drones - it also includes education, bystander recruitment programs/apps, etc.). For an example, Toronto EMS has a median response time around 7.5 minutes (meaning that 50% of the responses are longer!). We estimate that drones can cut that in half. You can take a look at the historical and estimated drone response time distributions on [page 22](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00149.pdf).

There's also is an interesting trade-off between urban and rural, which we call the efficiency vs equity trade-off. In urban areas, the improvement per case is small, but there are many cases (it's efficient to place drones here since they will be used a lot). In rural areas, the improvement per case is large, but there are only a few cases (it's equitable to place drones here so that we can match the urban response times). I don't know which is better, but we discuss this idea on [page 25](https://arxiv.org/pdf/1908.00149.pdf).

Fossil fuels have spent more on anti-nuclear propaganda than they have denying climate change, and for decades longer too, but they did so mainly through fake environmental groups to make it seem more legitimate. People are less likely to scrutinize conflicts of interest when it comes from ""Natural Resources Defense Council"" or ""Friends of the Earth"". They've tricked many environmentalists into being unwitting allies of fossil fuels against their largest clean competition, and renewables are an incredible useful tool to paint this campaign as ""green""

https://www.forbes.com/sites/kensilverstein/2016/07/13/are-fossil-fuel-interests-bankrolling-the-anti-nuclear-energy-movement/

The only zero-emissions energy scenario that doesn't require *trillions* of dollars of storage is renewables plus nuclear. So fossil fuels pitted renewables and nuclear advocates against each other to delay this outcome, largely by fooling people into thinking ""100% renewables"" can work in order to help justify anti-nuclear policies disguised as pro-renewables, so that people concerned about climate change will argue with each other over which is better instead of working together to replace fossil fuels.

There is very little risk from fossil fuels supporting renewables. Wind and solar have only a tiny market share in the US and they rely on fossil fuel backups anyway. Meanwhile natural gas is what almost entirely replaces every shuttered nuclear plant rather than renewables, even in California. So fossil fuels profit the most from asinine ""nuclear phase-outs"" and unfair RPS programs that force utilities to buy renewables *instead* of nuclear.

https://www.forbes.com/sites/michaelshellenberger/2019/03/28/the-dirty-secret-of-renewables-advocates-is-that-they-protect-fossil-fuel-interests-not-the-climate/

>Their ad blitz has targeted the global elite in airports and on Twitter. “Natural gas is the perfect partner for renewables,” say airport ads run by Norwegian oil and gas giant Statoil. “See why #natgas is a natural partner for renewable power sources,” tweets Shell.

Nothing will keep us dependant on fossil fuel energy longer than throwing away our nuclear power assets. Just ask renewables-loving Germany who expects to be burning coal for electricity well into the 2040's without them.

https://www.bloomberg.com/graphics/2018-germany-emissions/

In addition, America's wealthiest coal baron is also America's wealthiest solar baron and one of the most generous donors to the Democrat party. Tom Steyer hates fair competition and is a major contributor to the otherwise incomprehensible resistance some Democrats have to America's largest and most practical source of clean energy.

https://www.powerlineblog.com/archives/2014/04/the-epic-hypocrisy-of-tom-steyer.php

Thankfully more and more scientists are speaking out against this deception, most notably the IPCC themselves who explicitly stated *there is no scenario without nuclear power* where warming can be limited to 1.5 C (and it will have to increase 2.5-fold).

https://www.world-nuclear.org/press/press-statements/the-ipcc-1-5c-special-report-nuclear-energy’s-impo.aspx

So to claim we don't need nuclear power at this point is literally to be a climate science denier, and more and more people are starting to recognize this. As such, the grip of the anti-nuclear facade is starting to fail as many states are replacing their unfair RPS rackets with Clean Energy Standards that include **all** sources of clean energy, which allows *several-fold* higher clean energy targets with less economic harm, while also promoting fair competition and innovation.

Bullshit. Chapter 2 highlights numerous studies that evaluate desirable carbon trajectories in the context of expanded or sustained nuclear investment in the world's energy portfolio. Chapter 2, Section 2.4.2.1, indicates that the bulk of 1.5 C compatible energy pathways incorporates an increased role for nuclear power.

To quote, ""The current deployment pace of nuclear energy is constrained by social acceptability in many countries due to concerns over risks of accidents and radioactive waste management (Bruckner et al., 2014)"". (Chapter 4, Section 4.3.1.3 )

This is about as clear as an indictment of the social and cultural factors preventing the incorporation of nuclear into a diverse energy portfolio that *includes* renewables and storage. This is a direct result of people such as yourself spreading misinformation in places, like this sub, that purport themselves to be credible sources. Just like the IPCC report I linked states---the reasonable gave way to the misinformed.

If I am Fossil Fuel and I have $100 and I find $10 then my net worth grew 10%.  If you are Renewables and you have $2 and you find 60 cents then your net worth grew 30% or three times mine.  This is good for the renewables.  But that growth would need to sustain itself for a while in order to catch up.  

Also from the linked article:"" Our analysis also suggests that in the US, nearly ten times more people were employed in the green economy and its supply chains (9.5 million) than employed directly in the fossil fuel industry (roughly 1 million)—that is, miners, electricity grid workers, infrastructure manufacturers, and construction workers.

> The only thing they risk is having to become workers.

So you just ignore the part where they risk losing their investment? You know, that initial investment made to start the company? Sometimes taken straight out of an individual's life savings? Losing this investment is a very real risk buddy, I don't know what's so hard to grasp about this. 

> which should belong to them

No it shouldn't. They are not solely responsible for having created that wealth. They are getting a pay check proportional to the amount of work they have done for the company responsible for maintaining the entire process required to generate wealth through labor. You seem to think labor is the only thing required in order to create wealth but that's not how it works. Economy of scales allows large companies to generate a profit in a way that no single worker ever could. Your labor has no inherent value beyond what someone else is willing to pay for it.

You say the word ""should"" alot, but you really have no idea how things ""should"" be. Meanwhile all I'm saying is things are pretty damn good the way they are, with freedom of choice and all that, since I'm not forced to work for anyone or any salary I do not wish to. Seems to be yet another very hard concept to understand for commies.

> People still work because if they didn't they would starve and be homeless, not because the system is fair and they love it.

That's funny because under communism / socialism, people are starving and homeless despite working. But I'm sure that's way more fair, because at least we're all equally starving and homeless. I'll pick the unfair system for now though, I kinda enjoy not starving. 

> People call their wages ""fair"" because capitalism is the status quo and socialism is virtually non existent.

No, it's because they see their time and skills as being worth just about what they get paid. Someone who feels their wage is unfair has the right to negotiate for a fair wage or go work for another company. 

Also, don't you think there's a reason why socialism is virtually non existent? Hint : it has to do with the sustainability of socialist society. Extra Hint ( commie trigger warning ) : [The state of Venezuela](https://economics21.org/how-socialism-destroyed-venezuela). No matter how much you try to say Venezuela isn't ""real"" socialism, it is. That's what socialism does to a country. Deny it if it makes you feel better.

> No? Those people are workers and they get to enjoy the fruits of their labour, which is what socialism is all about.

Being able to enjoy the fruit of your labor is 100% capitalist. Socialism says everyone in society should be allowed to enjoy that fruit.

> How do you know I'm not a ""rich hypocrite who doesn't practice what he preaches""? Look, I get it, nobody is allowed to criticize capitalism, ever.

Because you're literally complaining about how working for a wage is unfair and evil and preaching a system which pretends to be for the greater good when all it does it take money from the rich to give to the poor, something that already happens thanks to the free will of capitalists like Bill Gates. Literally the only ""rich hypocrite who doesn't practice what he preaches"" socialists are left wing politicians and I doubt you are one.

> Workers create wealth while people like Bezos drain it from the economy.

Bezos actually creates so much wealth he can afford to give billions to charity. Wanna try again?

> I hope you are a business owner, because otherwise this is the most cucked shit I've ever seen. Being mad at poor people for being ""drains"" on the economy while capitalists hoard billions of dollars who could otherwise be used to improve the lives of millions.

How is this ""cucked shit"" lmfao? I will never feel an ounce of empathy for welfare leeches that would be capable of working but refuse to do it. And you wanna know a surefire way to make it so this money ""hoarding"" you speak of goes into overdrive? Implement socialism into your society. Rich people stay rich because they know how money works and they will run the fuck away from your country as soon as socialism arrives.

Also, the idea that tax haven money being spent on ""improving the lives of millions"" would actually do anything at all is so shortsighted it hurts. Do you have any idea how much money our developed modern society has been spending towards helping poor countries? Better question, when was the last time you remember a large monetary donation magically pulling a poor country out of poverty permanently? What about socialism? Has it ever turned a country full of poverty into a country where everyone is happy?

If the only factor driving poverty around the world was a lack of money, it would have been solved a long time ago. Again, you are using emotion based reasoning in an attempt to say that socialism would somehow solve this problem, but you don't even understand the underlying cause.
